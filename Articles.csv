Perarivalan, made a sworn statement before the Supreme Court that the CBI omitted the part of his confession where he said he had “absolutely no idea” of the purpose for which the two nine-volt batteries he bought would be used for.', 'Perarivalan has been in prison for 26 years for his role in procuring the two batteries which the prosecution said were used in the belt bomb which killed Mr. Gandhi in 1991 at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu.', 'V. Thiagarajan, in an affidavit dated October 27, 2017, submitted that Perarivalan’s statement that “he was totally in the dark as to the purpose for which the batteries were purchased was not recorded by me, because it would have been an exculpatory statement and hence the whole purpose of recording the confessional statement would be lost.”', '“Further I did not deem it fit to record this exculpatory statement because the investigation regarding the bomb was pending at the time of recording the confessional statement and even till date,” Mr. Thiagarajan stated.', '‘Ignorance confirmed’', 'He said the CBI was not sure about the part played by Perarivalan, but his ignorance about the conspiracy was confirmed as the investigation into the assassination progressed.', 'Mr. Thiagarajan referred to a wireless message of May 7, 1991 from mastermind Sivarasan to LTTE top operative Pottu Amman in which the former said “our intention is not known to anybody except we three,” meaning himself, Subha and Dhanu, the suicide bomber.', 'He said a “mere act” of providing batteries would not make Perarivalan privy to the conspiracy to kill Mr. Gandhi. The wireless message made it clear that Perarivalan was not taken into confidence.', 'Mr. Thiagarajan said the Supreme Court “was gracious and highly considerate” to spare the death penalty to Perarivalan in 2014.', 'He said remission for Perarivalan from the rest of the sentence is “long overdue.”', 'He said he had taken the “considered decision to come forward before the Supreme Court to put the facts pertaining to the confessional statement recorded by me in the proper perspective so as to facilitate this court to render justice.”', 'Perarivalan’s counsel Gopal Sankaranarayanan submitted before a Bench led by Justice Ranjan Gogoi that the LTTE’s chief arms procurer of the time is in a Sri Lankan prison. Counsel said probe agencies are still trying to question this man.', 'Two weeks time', '“The person who made the bomb is in a prison in Sri Lanka and they (agencies) have till date not questioned this man. The boy who bought two batteries has been languishing in jail for 26 years. And it is speculative if the batteries were even used in the bomb,” Mr. Sankaranarayanan submitted.', 'The Bench gave the Centre two weeks to decide whether it agrees with the Tamil Nadu government’s decision to grant Perarivalan remission. The next date of hearing is December 6. He was granted parole in August this year for the first time since his arrest in mid-1991.', '', 'Part of his confession where he states his ignorance was omitted', 'V.

The prime accused who had an altercation with Najeeb the night before [he went missing] are roaming freely and have not been questioned. Instead, the police and the media have been coming out with absurd theories. ”', 'In October, the High Court had pulled up the CBI for its “complete lack of interest” and not showing any results in the case. Najeeb, a first-year student of M.Sc. Biotechnology, went missing from JNU on October 15 last year following a scuffle with some students the night before. It was then alleged that they were linked to the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad.']"

New Delhi,"['A study conducted on Delhi children and released recently in the Journal of Indian Pediatrics provides powerful evidence that shows children growing up in polluted environments like the Capital have reduced lung growth compared to children in developed countries like the United States.', 'Indian children show slower lung growth and reach a final size that is lower than the growth and size found in Caucasian children in the US. While children in both India and the US have nearly the same lung size till the age of about 8 years, when lungs complete their normal physical growth, subsequent growth is progressively different in both nations. Lung size in both Indian boys and girls is about 10% smaller when they reach adulthood.', 'The study was conducted by Prof. S. K. Chhabra, former Director-Professor at Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute and current Head of Department, Pulmonary Medicine, Primus Hospital, New Delhi.', 'Childhood infections', 'The study highlights how air quality and childhood infections influence lung growth, besides genetic factors. Air pollution retards lung growth in Delhi’s children and even Indian adults have smaller lungs compared to their US counterparts. Smaller lungs mean poorer exercise capacity, and greater vulnerability to respiratory symptoms and diseases. This is especially scary given that 40% of urban children live in cities.', 'Reacting to the study, Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said: “If this does not wake us up to the health emergency, what will? Those who are in denial over environmental pollution-related deaths and illnesses in India should understand that the scary death tally and illnesses in Indians and children make a mockery of the country’s growth story. India will have to do drastically a lot more to reduce pollution exposure and not less. It will be criminal not to act on the mounting health evidence and ask for more evidence from our own children, the elderly and the vulnerable.”', 'A release issued by the CSE on Tuesday noted that leading medical and public health experts came together on Tuesday under the aegis of the Indian Council of Medical Research, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, to release the first-ever systematic assessment of burden of disease at both the national and State-level in India. The report notes the progress in increasing life expectancy across the country and in all States, although improvements vary substantially across States. However, the report warns that air pollution remains the second most important risk factor nationally.', 'Health risks', '“Simultaneously, the report of the Lancet Commission on Health and Pollution has looked at the full range of environmental health risks based on the systematic global burden of disease estimates. This shows some nine million deaths occur each year worldwide due to air, water and chemical exposure. Air pollution is at the top of the list, with outdoor and indoor air pollution contributing the lion’s share, some six million deaths. India remains one of the worst affected, with 1.9 million premature deaths due to outdoor and indoor air pollution,” noted the release.', 'The group noted that the evidence makes it clear that comprehensive and long-term strategies for reducing air pollution are critical to protect public health. At the same time, they note that this is likely an underestimate and that there are many exposures for which data is not yet strong enough to quantify the effects.']"

After DWCCs were set up, nearly 80% of the dry waste that is received comprises of these materials,” she said.', 'Hasiru Dala studied the kind of waste that was coming into the DWCCs it managed.

Wilson, representing the DMK, made the submission before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice M. Sundar while arguing a contempt of court application filed by the party against Chief Secretary Girija Vaidyanathan and State Election Commissioner M. Malik Feroze Khan, among others. The contempt application had been filed for allegedly disobeying an order passed by the court on a batch of writ appeals, including one filed by the DMK, on September 4 directing the Commission to issue a notification for the local body polls by September 18 and complete the entire process by November 17.', 'Mr. Khan contended that the elections could not be conducted due to an ordinance promulgated by the government on September 3 repealing certain legal provisions related to territorial division of civic bodies into wards and thereby creating a peculiar situation where “there exists no wards” as on date.', 'However, terming it to be “a larger game played by the government in connivance with the State Election Commission,” Mr. Wilson said that propriety would require the government to have sought the leave of the court before promulgating the Ordinance since the Bench had already heard the writ appeals at length and reserved its verdict during that time.', '“In fact, your lordships had listed the matter on September 1 (Friday) for pronouncing orders. On that day, there was no sitting and so it was posted on September 4. On Sunday (September 3), they bring in an Ordinance and repeal certain provisions without realising that even after the repeal, substantive provisions of the law related to local bodies remain unaffected,” he said.', '“By repealing these provisions and removing them from the statute books, it does not mean the Commission is helpless. What is required is a simple notification. It is the constitutional obligation of the election commissioner to conduct the elections,” he argued.', 'The Bench adjourned further hearing to Thursday.']"

I decided by early adulthood that I wanted to create a life where poetry was central. I was never going to be extraordinarily rich or famous but that was okay! I just wanted to hang around poems. Poetry seemed like the most direct and profound verbal route to myself that I knew. Everything else seemed peripheral.It was around 1997 that I found that there were vast zones of myself that were impermeable to language. Other tools were needed to access those zones — other archaeological implements, as it were. And so the spiritual journey took on a certain urgency: I was still a poet, but even more fundamentally, a seeker. In 2004 I met Sadhguru and that marked yet another shift. I'm still a seeker but perhaps a more committed seeker than a seeker at large."", 'You once said that a poem can change a life...', ""The changes that poetry initiate are subtle.

Chennai,"['It’s been a rocky ride for the Royal Enfield Himalayan. The bike received high praise at the test ride event in Shimla, where it impressed in the environment it was designed for and named after. But then things went a bit downhill, with numerous reliability issues cropping up. Royal Enfield eventually stopped sale, as the company set about developing a BS4-spec version of the bike, and it also used the opportunity to make a number of changes and improvements to address other reported issues. We spent quality time with the new bike and here’s what we found.', 'On the face of it', 'The Himalayan looks identical at first glance and it continues to offer a Spartan simplicity that conveys an unusual, but likeable sense of ruggedness and purpose. The exposed steel frame and masses of metal tubing that make up the rear rack, foot peg holders and front crash protection, account for a big part of the design, but the exposed welds are still quite messy. There are improvements though: the oil cooler now gets a small metal guard and the black plastic caps on the fairing that were prone to popping have been fixed. They all stayed in place despite a full day of rough roads, potholes and some off-road fun.', 'Further finish changes come in a new matte-black powder-coating for the fuel tank cap, bar-end weights and luggage mounts below the rear seat. Apparently, the old silver finish was prone to wearing quickly and the new black treatment, despite feeling coarse, should fare better. The switchgear continues to feel basic and the headlamp is now an AHO affair. The rest remains familiar. The quirky clocks take some getting used to, but are clear and offer plenty of information. The suspension, wheels, tyres, brakes and exhaust are all familiar, but if you peer through the engine area, you will notice one difference, the lack of a carburettor.', 'Touch to torque', 'To meet the higher emission norms of BS4, Royal Enfield dropped the carb for fuel injection and the result is positive. Throttle response is smooth and easy to modulate. Power arrives in a thoroughly linear fashion and there are no spikes or hesitations anywhere in the rev range. If anything, the engine feels smoother than before, while offering the same, lovely spread of torque from upwards of 2,000rpm. Thanks to the increased refinement, highway cruising at speeds of 90-100kmph is fairly sustainable, but the engine still feels stressed above that. The five-speed gearbox is now smoother and even indulges clutchless shifts.', 'We still believe the Himalayan deserves much more outright power, but the rideability at low revs cannot be faulted. The bike is easy to pilot in urban conditions, thanks to a strong bottom end, decently weighted clutch, wide handlebar and a friendly seat height of 800mm. Heat management is given a boost through a wider pipe for the oil-cooler, which enables better flow and, hence, the improved cooling. The Himalayan runs fairly warm in traffic, but it’s nowhere close to something like a 390 Duke and shouldn’t be a cause for discomfort.', 'The Himalayan continues to offer a fabulous ability to traverse broken roads with ease. Coupled with the neutral seating position, this is one of the most comfortable bikes for the price. Handling is stable and willing, but we wish the brakes had been improved. The front continues to have a wooden feel and requires a lot of pressure at the lever for strong performance, and there isn’t much in the way of feel from the 21-inch front wheel either.

This Perumbavoor-based filmmaker had earlier made television programmes and children’s serials.', 'Shot entirely at locations in Pattambi, the entire cast and crew of the film are newcomers. “The events in the film are knit in a storytelling technique, like myths and grandma’s tales. The story progresses through the protagonist, Prakasan, and his family, who lead a peaceful life in a picturesque Palakkadan village. The characters are all good-natured, who bond with Nature, share similar likes and dislikes. Life is uncomplicated. Into their life enter Manu and Ajayan, typical men of the city. The story takes off from here.”', 'Nature and Mother are two important symbols that link the characters. “Nature is also a character. The links between Nature and Mother are probed through various images, but through different experiences. A sacred grove, for instance, is dear to Prakasan, because he associates it with his dead mother. She used to light a lamp here every evening. And this sacred grove also plays an important role in the progress of the story.”', 'Written and scripted by Jibin and Sreekanth, the film has one song, a lullaby, penned by Shincy Noble, set to music by Shine Pullickal and sung by Delcy Ninan. “Baiju Ramapuram (cinematography), Jobins Sebastian (editing) and Nidhish Viswambaran (sound mixing) have done a great job.

It’s got seven seats, serious off-road hardware, powerful engines, a 340hp petrol included. How it all comes together is what we want to find out.', 'Large and strong', 'The Land Rover Discovery is nearly 5m long, is properly tall and dwarfs everything this side of the Mercedes-Benz GLS. The look is modern and it has its own unique design elements, like the gentle step in the roof, the upright tail-end and the long rear overhang. Sure, it doesn’t have the flash value of the Range Rovers and can even appear a bit ungainly and stretched when viewed from certain angles, but the Discovery looks the way it does for a reason. And that is to provide maximum room for its seven occupants.', 'Access to the third row involves a bit of twisting and contorting, and the seating position is slightly knees-up, but there’s enough space in the rearmost section of the cabin for even adults to sit in reasonable comfort. There’s loads of space in the middle row too, but the seats are set a tad lower than you’d like. The best seats in the house are the ones up front, richly finished and equipped with their own foldable armrests.', 'A happy consequence of the cabin being high-set (you step up into it rather than walk in — except for the second row we spoke about) is that you get a commanding view of the road. What’s also nice is the chunky, built-to-last look to everything inside. While there could have been more flair to the dashboard design, it all somehow goes with the Discovery’s no-nonsense persona. There’s practicality built into the cabin. There are multiple storage bays and as many as nine charging points scattered across the cabin.', 'Little things inside', 'You’ll also like the Disco’s 10-inch touchscreen for its slickness and speed; pity, there’s no Android Auto or Apple CarPlay. The Discovery is available in three trims and our mid-spec HSE spec test car did come with plenty of equipment. However, items such as cooled seats, twin sunroofs and even the third-row seats are on the options list, so account for spending big money on speccing your Discovery to the right level.', 'With all seats up, there’s enough space for a few soft bags, but with the second and third-row seats folded, the cavernous luggage bay can double as a bed for two adults — helpful when camping in the wild. The Discovery also gets a useful retractable shelf at the boot that can take up to 300kg of load.', 'Driving range', 'Land Rover has launched the Discovery with two engine options — a V6 turbo-diesel and a 340hp, V6 supercharged petrol unit. We tested the petrol version and came away impressed. The petrol Discovery is unexpectedly quick for something so large. Engine responses are crisp, and the experience just gets better and better the faster you go.', 'The mid-range (Rs. 82.77 lakh, ex-showroom, all India) is punchy and what makes the strong build-up of power to the 6,500rpm limiter even more special are the accompanying whirrs and whines of the engine.', 'The Discovery is just unshakeable on straight highways and isn’t perturbed by potholes taken even at high speeds. But a sporty SUV this is not. You can feel its enormous weight and size in corners. Drive within the Disco’s comfort zone though, and you’ll like how tidy the handling is, helped in no small measure by the feeling of control from the perfectly set-up steering. Still, the oversized Disco can feel intimidating to drive on packed city roads and there’s a hint of firmness from the air suspension at low speeds too.', 'As for off-road ability, the Discovery will just amaze you with how far it can go into the wild. Onboard is Land Rover’s Terrain Response system (it primes the engine, gearbox, steering, suspension and other electronics for various off-road scenarios) and there’s selectable low-range that gives the Discovery the desired low-speed grunt for the trickiest of situations. The suspension can be raised too, and at its highest, what you get is an incredible 283mm of ground clearance and 900mm wading depth!', 'Bottom line', 'The elephant in the room is the petrol motor’s heavy fuel consumption. Yes, the Rs. 15 lakh price gap to an equivalent diesel does soften the blow, and there are myriad benefits to driving a petrol car, things such as smoothness, a wide powerband and keen throttle response. But when we drove the car hard, it gave us no more than 5kpl, and whichever way you look at it, that’s a lot of fuel guzzled; precisely why the diesel version will continue to be popular with prudent Indian car buyers. If you can get your head (and wallet) around the high fuel bills, you will be rewarded with a snarling, happy-to-rev, fast, supercharged Jaguar-based petrol that’s a genuine delight to drive.', '', '', 'Land Rover Discovery specs', '', '', 'Length4600 mm', '', '', 'Width2069 mm', '', '', 'Height1690 mm', '', 'Wheelbase2741 mm', '', 'Conquering Land and Sea', 'Land Rover has also released a unique Floating Ninety Defender, which was copied from the design of several aquatic Series II military prototypes from the 1960s.']"

At a special screening of the HBO film at Phoenix Arena in Hyderabad, Everett Arthur delves into the emotionally raw and tender moments as his own search for clothing is being filmed.', 'Having graduated as a law student from Emory University in Atlanta, Everett understands the two very different sides to the coin that is his life. Being dressed accordingly for courtroom environments is key for any practising lawyer, so the 25 year-old found himself in a dilemma when he couldn’t find a suit that fit him after his transition. So he reached out to\nSuited\ndirector Jason Benjamin and everything came into place from there— a connection he calls “serendipitous.”', 'Suited\nfollows six individuals — Everett Arthur, Grace Dunham, Dr Jillian T Weiss, Daniel Friedman and Derek Matesson — who visit Bindle and Keep, a bespoke tailoring company headed up by Rae Tutera in New York who creates clothing for the LGBTQ community. The documentary is a narrative journey towards the acceptance and consciousness around the basic needs the everyday cisgender person doesn’t really worry about. After all, the typical clothing stencils do not necessarily fit trans bodies, be it at the shoulders, hips or waist. And if fashion exists to customise, why not meld the two? The film has been largely well-received since its premiere at Sundance 2016, where it was nominated for a Grand Jury Prize.', 'Being on set', 'The most important thing audiences see is how\nSuited\nsees every person coming to a whole new understanding about their body and the way in which they want to present themselves; it’s a liberating journey and Everett is on a par. “Being a part of\nSuited\nhelped me understand that gender is really a spectrum; I think when I first started transitioning, I was stuck to this whole idea of the binary. I feel more freely now to express my gender identity, so if I want to wear a choker one day, I can feel comfortable and free to experiment with that.”', 'Everett admits there was a particularly raw moment where he tried on the final suit and teared up, marking an integral milestone in his life.', '“I think it’s really helpful to find your ‘people’,” Everett starts, “By that, I mean those who love you no matter what. Through the documentary, I connected with Rae, one of the tailors at Bindle and Keep; I think it’s impactful to have people who see you regardless of whether or not you can afford the clothes that represent you. In the documentary, I also talk about my mom not being very comfortable about me being trans, but now she’s really on board and is really supportive. I think one thing that really helped her come to terms is me giving her patience. People are going to get things wrong, but as long as they’re trying I can understand that. One can always see when there’s a maliciousness or a genuine attempt to get a hang of someone else’s gender identity — it’s very different.”', 'The young lawyer adds that the\nSuited\nteam remain good friends to this day, having gone on profoundly similar journeys.', 'Everett’s final paper as a law student was around third gender markers in the United States, placing a parallel to the system in India where Tamil Nadu and Kerala have pioneered in trans rights. “It’s a double-edged sword; the similarity is that now a lot of states in the US like Oregon have third gender markers as an option and more states like California are looking to adopt that system. So I examined how beneficial that would be; for many people it’s important to be visible rather than being placed in silos and being ‘othered’ as a result. But there’s the notion of being visible, you are in fact applying a label to yourself.”', 'Creating an understanding', 'The importance of having accurate documentation really struck with Everett, who adds, “When you go to school, it’s not a problem to get your degree, which used to be a problem in India but now that’s obviously changed. The access to basic resources such as schooling should not be so burdensome, and I’m glad that’s changing everywhere.”', '', 'Through the documentary, I connected with Rae, one of the tailors at Bindle and Keep; I think it’s impactful to have people who see you regardless of whether or not you can afford the clothes that represent you.']"
Chennai,"['Any exercise to expose an evil serves no practical purpose if it is not followed by a drive to root it out. A recent survey by Maruti Suzuki points out that only 25% of drivers use seat belts in cars in India: that’s 1 in 4. At 4%, usage of rear seat belts is abysmally low. The automobile major deserves to be commended for this survey, which was promptly picked up by the media. However, one disturbing question looms large. In the absence of a powerful State-supported mechanism to act upon these findings, does this survey mean anything at all?', 'Across India, efforts by the traffic police to get occupants of cars to buckle up, have been desultory. There will be a sudden crackdown, followed by a long lull. There have been headline-grabbing exercises — cases of traffic police offering chocolates to those wearing seat belts, to reinforce the positive behaviour. But they are not sustained. The best results are seldom achieved by sudden bursts of activity, but by incremental efforts taken consistently over a long period of time. The Utah experience especially bears this out.', 'If you visited the government website of Utah, a state in the United States of America, you would get to read about surveys on seat belt use over the years. In 2017, Utah registered an 88.8% seat belt use by drivers and an 88.9% use by outboard passengers. The study covered cars, sports utility vehicles, trucks and vans, and was conducted on local roads, arterial roads and highways.', 'It took Utah over three decades of sustained efforts to achieve this result. This survey is being conducted every year, since 1986, by the Highway Safety Office under the Utah Department of Public Safety. The very first survey put seat belt use in Utah at 18%. From 18 to 88 — that’s really impressive.', 'Learning from Utah and other places with a similar experience, it’s clear that a combination of factors, which include strict enforcement, vehicle laws, awareness programmes and enthusiastic participation of various stakeholders, is necessary to achieve such results.', 'On the positive side, India seems headed towards making safety a key point in car manufacturing. The Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways wants all new cars from April 2018 to have a raft of safety features, which include a seat belt alarm.', 'The corporate world can contribute to this mission. I have come across corporates, especially in the IT sector, that don’t let employees enter their premises unless their seat belts are buckled up or their helmets strapped on. Initiatives of this nature are few, and many more are required to achieve critical mass. State agencies connected with road transport and voluntary organisations working in the field of road safety can encourage such efforts.', 'I have to return to Utah to illustrate this point. The Utah Safety Council, a not-for-profit organisation that offers resources pertaining to occupational safety training and traffic safety, has instituted an ‘Occupational Seat Belt Award’, which goes to any organisation that ensures 100% seat belt use among its employees.', 'The world of cinema and television can play a big role too. Directors of productions on both screens can ensure that their characters are buckled up in their car seats in scenes involving a drive.', 'And if an actor with considerable star value is shown buckling up before a drive, millions of fans may start doing this every time they take the wheel. Old films that have characters driving without seat belts can have a warning line citing what could happen if seat belts are ignored (much like the tobacco one we see currently).', 'Let’s use every opportunity to promote the idea of seat belt wearing. Little drops make up the mighty ocean.', '', 'Look back', 'The 3-point seatbelt was developed in its modern form by Swedish inventor Nils Bohlin for Volvo, who introduced it in 1959 as standard equipment.

The protagonists of this rebellion are: curated children’s segments at popular film festivals, a new series of books introducing kids to film classics, a TV network dedicating a channel to children’s films and India’s first online children’s film festival. Sounds straight out of some movie? Well, it’s not. Tired of waiting for children’s content to get a mainstream push in India, a few good adults are taking matters in their own hands and trying to bridge the gap between great cinema and children.', 'In\nStranger Things\n, the narrative centres around the theme of friendship. It’s the cornerstone of all our childhood experiences and that is why we relate to this content so much. Samina Mishra, a filmmaker, writer and teacher, chose to focus on the theme of friendship while curating this year’s Half Ticket (children’s segment) at the recently concluded 19th Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival.', 'Catching them young', 'Under the theme “the hand of friendship”, Mishra included classics like\nThe\nRed Balloon\n(1956) and\nAu Revoir les Enfants\n(1987), and even an older Children’s Film Society of India (CFSI) film called\nMujhse Dosti Karoge\n(1992). “Although some of these films have been around for more than 50 years and are available online as well, not many people know about it,” says Mishra.', 'Monica Wahi, also a children’s film curator, has selected children’s films for the recently concluded Dharamshala International Film Festivals (DIFF), and a set of films for the channel ‘Tata Sky Kids Cinema’, dedicated to showcasing children’s films from India and around the world. This includes award-winning Indian live-action films like\nHalo\n(1996),\nChutkan ki Mahabharat\n(2004) or\nI Am Kalam\n(2011) as well as animated films from around the world like the Japanese\nMy Neighbour Tortoro\n(1998) and French film\nA Cat in Paris\n(2010)\n.', 'But why do we need to introduce children to cinema? Wahi is of the opinion that films become a means to opening up their worldview. “The kind of environment that kids are living in today is a boxed-up one,” she says. “So how do you expose children to a wider experience?”', 'Not only does exposure to cinema increase our knowledge of the world, it also helps alter our understanding of it. “Cinema is a very powerful medium to reconsider our opinion of the world,” Wahi affirms. “We need to open the world of the child, give them the opportunity to look at the world in a new way or discover things they haven’t seen before or feel empathetic.” Both Mishra and Wahi believe that unlike the assumptions adults make about children’s acceptance of serious content, they are actually quite open to complex issues like death, immigration or inequality.', 'In an example of a film that helped children express their deepest thoughts or question their own prejudices, Wahi recalls being pleasantly surprised at the response to a 2016 film called\nWindow Horses\n. The film was about a Canadian girl who goes to Iran to perform at a poetry festival. After watching the film, a young audience member said, “I thought Iran was a land of terrorists and now I realise that Iran is a land of poetry, humour and much more.” Another film, on disability, brought out responses on caste discrimination faced at school.', 'Mishra narrates a similar experience at MAMI, when the children’s jury awarded the animated short film called\nHalf A Life\n– which was about being a young gay activist man in Egypt. “They not only felt it was something that they should know and think about, but also enjoyed the documentary form of the film,” recalls Mishra.', 'What fascinates both the curators is how within the space of a few hours one can absolutely change the way kids look at the world. And it not only leads to challenging them but also questions the opinions of grown-ups within the family or within school.', 'Cinema in a book', 'Asking the right questions is what film critic and author Raja Sen wants children to do once they read or hear his poetic retelling of the film classic\nThe Godfather\n. Sen’s new book,\nThe Best Baker in the World\nis part of a series by Penguin’s Puffin imprint, titled ‘My First Matinee’.', 'Sen chose the limerick form to introduce the film to children because he wanted them to have fun reading it, so that the stories would roll off the tongue easily. It also comes with a set of quirky illustrations; with each character represented as the animal they embody the best.', 'Having grown up in a typically artistic Bengali family, Sen was exposed to good cinema early. But also felt that he didn’t always understand it when he watched it as a child.', 'The book then becomes a way to introduce such films to kids and some day when they do watch the film, they can get a better understanding of it. But one can also ask whether this is the “right” film to introduce to children. When it comes to kids’ content, isn’t there always an assumption about what is and what is not a children’s film?', '“You create this world for a kid where you’re replacing what was much more dark and sinister with something else – because the kids understand drama and storytelling,” says Sen. “So what would be an assassination in one world, could be the popping of a particular favourite balloon in the child’s life – it could have the same emotional heft.”', 'New forums', 'With the proliferation of the online space, it’s easy to find films, but what is difficult, is curating the right kind of content for a child. School Cinema, the film arm of LXL Ideas, makes short films on life skills and these are accompanied by workbooks, which go directly to school children. As a part of their efforts to introduce good cinema to kids, they are organising a week-long online children’s film festival called the International Kids Film Festival of India.', 'The festival will run this week (Nov 14-19), with films curated from India and around the world. “We felt that an online film would be more accessible than having it in just one theatre,” said Neha Jain, head - films, LXL Ideas. “Often parents are unable to take children to film festivals for practical reasons. We wanted the schools to take the onus and host the festival.”', 'But how did they choose the films? The aesthetics of cinema is something that Jain feels is important to introduce children to. “We’re looking at several things - the cinematic appeal, aesthetics of the film as a work of art, the relevance for Indian children – themes and stories,” she says.', 'Among the films to be screened is this film called\nLila,\na non-verbal short film about a girl who uses imagination and creativity to complete stories she sees around her. This is not about a message, but is about imagination. There is also a documentary film called\nConfessions of a Social Bully\n, which talks about the relevant issue of bullying, but in a format that is arresting and engaging to watch.', 'Baby steps', 'This quiet rebellion by a handful of adults gives one the feeling that things might be shifting ever so slightly in the domain of children’s cinema in India. But one realises that both the state and the film industry need to shift their focus towards making this happen on a larger scale. Meanwhile, Mishra is hopeful about the individuals and organisations making such an effort. “There is no point in dismissing everything,” she says. “There is so much material available to engage children with the arts, we have to just think of interesting ways of how to do it.”', 'For more details on the International Kids Film Festival of India, see: http://ikffi.lxl.in/']"
Hyderabad,"['A movement for performing arts by youngsters, for youngsters. That was how Svanubhava was envisioned in 2008. What began as a festival just taking Carnatic music and Bharatanatyam to school children in the private and public space has now branched out to engulf art forms across the spectrum: from classical music to folksy notes and even, pop culture. In fact, some of the organisers want to even do away with labelling art forms, as they find each form is unique in its aesthetics. Now in its 10th year, the core organisers tell us where the movement stands and the introspection that has gone into its evolution: it is now an inclusive festival accessible to school children across seven cities, four states and two countries.', 'When the movement kicked off, the focus was just on Bharatanatyam and Carnatic music. Two years later, other classical art forms were added, including Hindustani (music), Kathak and Odissi. And, by 2012, lesser-known art forms were added to the mix: think Paavakathakali, Shadow Puppetry, Yakshagaana, Silambattam and martial art forms from Northeastern India, Therukoothu, Khawali. Baul music and Bengali theatre soon crept in too. The latest addition in the repertoire is contemporary English theatre. The festival has taken around 90 forms of performing arts to at least 90 to 100 schools over the course of a year. They have even had students from cities such as Kancheepuram, Tiruvannamalai, Ranipet, Cuddalore, Chidambaram and Tiruchi as audience.', 'A transformative experience', 'Since its inception, the movement has been evolving in terms of venues, programme repertoire and audience. It has been marked by a strong presence ofyouth, without an overbearing presence of a mentor or “guru” in the traditional sense. TM Krishna and Bombay Jayashree who conceptualised the movement in 2008 with their Matrka initiative, later handed over the baton to younger artistes. One of the venues of the first two years was initially the green, soulful campus of Kalakshetra — under the banyan tree or inside Rukmini Devi arangam, where violins would belt out alaapanas and the dancers, their eyes smudged with thick kohl, would dance to\njathis\nand\npadams.\nExperiencing art forms in spaces like these, is different from being exposed to them on a school campus, says Vidhya Raghavan, organisor and a Carnatic vocalist. “They are inspired to pursue them seriously as a career choice.”', 'The festival has not just transformed the audience, but also organisers. Over waffles and tea at a cafe, Rithvik Raja, part of the core committee discloses how the festival changed him. When he started, he knew little outside the world of Carnatic music, he says.The festival shifted his perception of art just like how the changing food culture in the city has made him shift from South Indian cuisine to Italian, now, he says. He talked about how it has even widened his sartorial horizons, inspiring him to wear bold, bright colours during a concert instead of his usual subdued shades. “Svanubhava opened me to different approaches in art, practise methodologies, and rituals followed by artistes. Even the way the tambura is tuned before a performance differs from one artiste to the other. Or, how a Therukoothu artist preparing for a performance — in silence, all calm but intense — is a learning experience.', 'The highlight of the festival format is the 15-minute interactive session after the performance where children can interact with the artist. “We never filter the questions. I still recall one asked by a five-year-old at the end of a session featuring Vikku Vinayakram. ‘Sir, you played so well. You were hitting that pot so hard. What will you do if the pot breaks?’ I still recall how it became a bigger news than the festival itself that year. I am sure we as adults have many such questions. But, we are too embarrassed to ask.”', 'Bridges and more', 'In this year’s edition, the festival has extended to the college campuses of the Indian Institute of Technology - Madras and Asian College of Journalism. In ACJ, the media students found Therukoothu and Kattaikoothu artistes strolling into their campuses for a performance. The session on bridging the gap between the academic and the artistic realms in IIT featured vocalist TM Krishna and historian and scholar, AR Venkatachalapathy, who steered the discussion to how class, caste and culture play a crucial role in the accessibility of these art forms. Some of the research scholars pointed out the lacunae in academics to address aesthetics. Krishna found the session invigorating and marking possibilities in the future.', '“Maybe this is a new direction we can explore. It looks like a new kind of a dialogue. I also know that Svanubhava is happening in other cities. There is an individual group in Hyderabad, who we are supporting from here. And, maybe in Chennai, we could think of new bridges. And, academics is a new bridge.”', 'Svanubhava On The Go is one of their lesser publicised programmes that happens throughout the year in educational institutions. Apart from the main event, they are planning a carnival like Svanubhava in the Vidya Vanam school in Anaikatti with tents where multiple events will be hosted. Raja says the idea is to create a sense of community, across classes.', '“Just like bringing different art forms on one proscenium, it is also about bringing different kinds of audience on the other side of the podium.”', '', '', ""In this year', the festival has extended into the college campuses of Indian Institute of Technology, Madras and Asian College of Journalism."", '', 'The pizza was invented in Naples during the 18th Century.

He knows how he has to stay relevant to today’s modern women, who could be living in New York, Tokyo, Copenhagen or any of Indian metros. Diamond often figures in his creations — earrings, bracelets, necklaces — as he believes in the adage “diamonds are forever.”', 'Talking about his love for elephants, Nirav says, “Elephants are very dear to me. It is a very powerful yet gentle animal, and very regal. If you look at our monogram closely, it is an elephant (it has its trunk and back.) We have been supporting the animal family since last year. For us, it is a long partnership and not just restricted to Elephant Parade. We have painted the elephant with grey colour; it has blue eyes and our jewellery gives it a majestic look.”', 'An elephant pendant is something he loves talking about. “My satisfaction comes from how a woman reacts to my creation. 99.9 per cent of my jewellery is for women. Our aesthetics is very feminine,” he relates.', 'Engineering in art', 'For Nirav, designing jewellery is about the meeting of art and science. “Art makes a woman visualise how she would look. Science would determine how it would fall on her. We have many engineers working for us. You must be wondering what engineers are doing in a jewellery company. They give us an edge. Even after 30 years, a piece will effortlessly open into multiple pieces like a USB port, and not be worn out. Every jewel is handmade whether it is a red carpet jewel or one of the pieces from our core collections. It is of the same creator, same workshop and same quality. If you see any other brands, one side of jewellery is handmade, rest is machine made.”', 'Talking about his art, Nirav confides that he cannot draw. “But I pass on inspiration, idea, emotion and thought. From that my team of designers first create the mood board and then make sketches. I guide them at each step. After all, we have been diamond merchants for seven generations.”', 'Nirav goes down memory lane to share his first brush with designing. “When I was in my late 30s, I created an earring for my friend. That spurred me to start a luxury brand. I wanted to be India’s first luxury brand. Today everything you see in this segment whether it is car, clothes shoes, handbag are all European. There is no Asian luxury brand which has gone global. Generally people have reservation on what the quality would be in an Asian brand. So we are changing mindsets.”', 'His signature floral designs, which can be seen in multiple pieces like earrings, necklaces, have influences from abroad are inspired by the works of French impressionist painter Claude Monet. “Our Lotus collection is from the botanical works of Monet. I saw his work at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and was so fascinated that we travelled to the place where he worked outside Versailles . We also have jasmine in many pieces because of its aesthetic appeal.”', 'Interestingly, seeds for Sakura, his floral collection, were sown when he started travelling to Japan during the initial phase of his career. “This led to my creation of Cherry Blossom,” says Nirav, who can read and write Japanese.', 'Explaining the reason behind deviating from traditional jewellery, Nirav says: “For us, a large part of our sale is out of India. Of 16 stores, only three exist in India. First consideration while making an earring or a pendant is that it has to have a global aesthetic appeal.All our jewels are light, supple and very little metal.” That is also the reason that he signed Priyanka Chopra as the brand ambassador. “She is also an Indian going global. It was natural to endorse her.”', '']"
Hyderabad,"['A chance to goon a Himalayan OdysseySPECIAL ARRANGEMENT', 'It’s been a rocky ride for the Royal Enfield Himalayan. The bike received high praise at the test ride event in Shimla, where it impressed in the environment it was designed for and named after. But then things went a bit downhill, with numerous reliability issues cropping up. Royal Enfield eventually stopped sale, as the company set about developing a BS4-spec version of the bike, and it also used the opportunity to make a number of changes and improvements to address other reported issues. We spent some quality time with the new bike and here’s what we discovered.', 'On the face of it', 'The Himalayan looks identical at first glance and it continues to offer a Spartan simplicity that conveys an unusual, but likeable sense of ruggedness and purpose. The exposed steel frame and masses of metal tubing that make up the rear rack, foot peg holders and front crash protection, account for a big part of the design, but the exposed welds are still quite messy. There are improvements though: the oil cooler now gets a small metal guard and the black plastic caps on the fairing that were prone to popping have been fixed. They all stayed in place despite a full day of rough roads, potholes and some off-road fun.', 'Further finish changes come in a new matte-black powder-coating for the fuel tank cap, bar-end weights and luggage mounts below the rear seat. Apparently, the old silver finish was prone to wearing quickly and the new black treatment, despite feeling coarse, should fare better. The switchgear continues to feel basic and the headlamp is now an AHO affair. The rest remains familiar. The quirky clocks take some getting used to, but are clear and offer plenty of information. The suspension, wheels, tyres, brakes and exhaust are all familiar, but if you peer through the engine area, you will notice one difference, the lack of a carburettor.', 'Touch to torque', 'To meet the higher emission norms of BS4, Royal Enfield dropped the carb for fuel injection and the result is positive. Throttle response is smooth and easy to modulate. Power arrives in a thoroughly linear fashion and there are no spikes or hesitations anywhere in the rev range. If anything, the engine feels smoother than before, while offering the same, lovely spread of torque from upwards of 2,000rpm. Thanks to the increased refinement, highway cruising at speeds of 90-100kph is fairly sustainable, but the engine still feels stressed above that. The five-speed gearbox is now smoother and even indulges clutchless shifts.', 'We still believe the Himalayan deserves much more outright power, but the rideability at low revs cannot be faulted. The bike is easy to pilot in urban conditions, thanks to a strong bottom end, decently weighted clutch, wide handlebar and a friendly seat height of 800mm. Heat management is given a boost through a wider pipe for the oil-cooler, which enables better flow and, hence, the improved cooling. The Himalayan runs fairly warm in traffic, but it’s nowhere close to something like a 390 Duke and shouldn’t be a cause for discomfort.', 'The Himalayan continues to offer a fabulous ability to traverse broken roads with ease. Coupled with the neutral seating position, this is one of the most comfortable bikes for the price. Handling is stable and willing, but we wish the brakes had been improved. The front continues to have a wooden feel and requires a lot of pressure at the lever for strong performance, and there isn’t much in the way of feel from the 21-inch front wheel either. ABS would have been very welcome.', 'Feel factor', 'At 191kg, the Himalayan, which was already a hefty beast, has gained nine additional kilos. However, it feels well-balanced and continues to be the best off-roader that money can buy in India, this side of behemoths like the Tiger 800 and Africa Twin. The Himalayan is confident and easy to throw around over loose surfaces, which encourages dirt noobs to have a lot of fun and return in one happy piece. That said, this bike is better for what I like to call relaxed enduro and doesn’t enjoy being pushed too hard. In that sense, it retains the Royal Enfield heritage of relaxed riding, while offering a more enjoyable and engaging experience', 'There’s no doubt that the Himalayan FI is an improvement over its predecessor, but is the new bike more reliable than the old one? That’s an answer we can give after we have been around it a while. We reached out to Royal Enfield and were told that the company has proactively addressed customer grievances with the previous bike and is now seeing increasing demand.', '', '', 'Specifications', '', '', 'Wheelbase1465 mm', '', '', 'Ground clearance220 mm', '', 'Length2190 mm', '', 'Movie time', '', 'In the Indian film industry, the Royal Enfield bikes are very popular, from playing a key role in the films themselves to being a key accessory in weddings, such as that of Bollywood actor Gul Panag a few years ago.']"

In the absence of a powerful State-supported mechanism to act upon these findings, does this survey mean anything at all?', 'Across India, efforts by the traffic police to get occupants of cars to buckle up, have been desultory. There will be a sudden crackdown, followed by a long lull. There have been headline-grabbing exercises — cases of traffic police offering chocolates to those wearing seat belts, to reinforce the positive behaviour. But they are not sustained. The best results are seldom achieved by sudden bursts of activity, but by incremental efforts taken consistently over a long period of time. The Utah experience especially bears this out.', 'If you visited the government website of Utah, a state in the United States of America, you would get to read about surveys on seat belt use over the years. In 2017, Utah registered an 88.8% seat belt use by drivers and an 88.9% use by outboard passengers. The study covered cars, sports utility vehicles, trucks and vans, and was conducted on local roads, arterial roads and highways.', 'It took Utah over three decades of sustained efforts to achieve this result. This survey is being conducted every year, since 1986, by the Highway Safety Office under the Utah Department of Public Safety. The very first survey put seat belt use in Utah at 18%. From 18 to 88 — that’s really impressive.', 'Learning from Utah and other places with a similar experience, it’s clear that a combination of factors, which include strict enforcement, vehicle laws, awareness programmes and enthusiastic participation of various stakeholders, is necessary to achieve such results.', 'On the positive side, India seems headed towards making safety a key point in car manufacturing. The Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways wants all new cars from April 2018 to have a raft of safety features, which include a seat belt alarm.', 'The corporate world can contribute to this mission. I have come across corporates, especially in the IT sector, that don’t let employees enter their premises unless their seat belts are buckled up or their helmets strapped on. Initiatives of this nature are few, and many more are required to achieve critical mass. State agencies connected with road transport and voluntary organisations working in the field of road safety can encourage such efforts.', 'I have to return to Utah to illustrate this point. The Utah Safety Council, a not-for-profit organisation that offers resources pertaining to occupational safety training and traffic safety, has instituted an ‘Occupational Seat Belt Award’, which goes to any organisation that ensures 100% seat belt use among its employees.', 'The world of cinema and television can play a big role too. Directors of productions on both screens can ensure that their characters are buckled up in their car seats in scenes involving a drive.', 'And if an actor with considerable star value is shown buckling up before a drive, millions of fans may start doing this every time they take the wheel. Old films that have characters driving without seat belts can have a warning line citing what could happen if seat belts are ignored (much like the tobacco one we see currently).', 'Let’s use every opportunity to promote the idea of seat belt wearing. Little drops make up the mighty ocean.', '', 'Look back', 'The 3-point seatbelt was developed in its modern form by Swedish inventor Nils Bohlin for Volvo, who introduced it in 1959 as standard equipment. Bohlin demonstrated its effectiveness in a study of 28,000 accidents in Sweden.']"

How it all comes together is what we want to find out.', 'Large and strong', 'The Land Rover Discovery is nearly 5m long, is properly tall and dwarfs everything this side of the Mercedes-Benz GLS. The look is modern and it has its own unique design elements, like the gentle step in the roof, the upright tail-end and the long rear overhang. Sure, it doesn’t have the flash value of the Range Rovers and can even appear a bit ungainly and stretched when viewed from certain angles, but the Discovery looks the way it does for a reason. And that is to provide maximum room for its seven occupants.', 'Access to the third row involves a bit of twisting and contorting, and the seating position is slightly knees-up, but there’s enough space in the rearmost section of the cabin for even adults to sit in reasonable comfort. There’s loads of space in the middle row too, but the seats are set a tad lower than you’d like. The best seats in the house are the ones up front, richly finished and equipped with their own foldable armrests.', 'A happy consequence of the cabin being high-set (you step up into it rather than walk in — except for the second row we spoke about) is that you get a commanding view of the road. What’s also nice is the chunky, built-to-last look to everything inside. While there could have been more flair to the dashboard design, it all somehow goes with the Discovery’s no-nonsense persona. There’s practicality built into the cabin. There are multiple storage bays and as many as nine charging points scattered across the cabin.', 'Little things inside', 'You’ll also like the Disco’s 10-inch touchscreen for its slickness and speed; pity, there’s no Android Auto or Apple CarPlay.

The mid-range (Rs 82.77 lakh, ex-showroom, all India) is punchy and what makes the strong build-up of power to the 6,500rpm limiter even more special are the accompanying whirrs and whines of the engine.', 'The Discovery is just unshakeable on straight highways and isn’t perturbed by potholes taken even at high speeds. But a sporty SUV this is not. Drive within the Disco’s comfort zone though, and you’ll like how tidy the handling is, helped in no small measure by the feeling of control from the perfectly set-up steering. Still, the oversized Disco can feel intimidating to drive on packed city roads and there’s a hint of firmness from the air suspension at low speeds too.', 'As for off-road ability, the Discovery will just amaze you with how far it can go into the wild.

Yes, the Rs. 15 lakh price gap to an equivalent diesel does soften the blow, and there are myriad benefits to driving a petrol car, things such as smoothness, a wide powerband and keen throttle response.

Hyderabad,"['Going green(Clockwise) A PEDL cycle and Greg MoranSpecial arrangement', 'Bicycle stands at strategic locations across neighbourhoods is a common sight in cities such as Amsterdam, London and New York. With dedicated cycle tracks and bike rentals, it isn’t uncommon to pedal your way through these cities. Now imagine if you could do the same here: just pick up a bike, cycle to your destination and drop it off. Well, that’s the vision Greg Moran, co-founder of Zoomcar, had when they decided to launch PEDL, the country’s only technology-enabled cycle sharing service.', 'Launched five months ago in Bengaluru, the service now has a presence in Chennai and Kolkata as well. And plans are afoot to launch in Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad by the end of November. Talking about the initiative, Moran says, “Ever since we’d launched Zoomcar, we’d seen a gap of zero to five kilometres in the market — the last mile segment. Since ours is a technology platform that offers mobility solutions, expanding on it was easy; it’s a flexible platform. In fact, when we’d started off, we’d considered a two-wheeler sharing option as well.”', 'Given our city streets are traffic-clogged, this initiative also fits in perfectly with the ‘smart city initiative’ being planned by various local governments. “Also, nobody was really looking into this space and it was a natural extension to our business,” says Moran.', 'PEDL offers users different types of cycles that can be used for rentals as well as sharing. “We’re looking at a hyperlocal approach, so a presence across most neighbourhoods in the cities where we are active. We’re actually looking at setting up pick-up and drop-off points every 50 to 100 metres. The idea is to let clients pick up the bicycles conveniently from a given location and drop them off as well,” he says, adding, they already see a strong demand in the segment with users across a wide age group. “We have people in their 20s and 30s picking up our cycles just as much as we have senior citizens doing so. People are viewing these cycles as healthier commuting alternatives,” he says.', 'The fact that it is also an extremely affordable alternative seems to click with users. Renting a bicycle through PEDL costs as less as Rs. 10 per half an hour. Much better than haggling with an autorickshaw driver, isn’t it?', 'But given the lack of bicycling tracks in our cities, will it really work? “I am from New York and when such initiatives were launched back home, there were very dedicated lanes for cycles. But the price points and convenience led to its growth,” he says, adding, “Given the kind of congestion we see on the streets here, cycling is faster and much more convenient when it comes to commuting short distances.” They currently have 3,000 cycles across the board. Their aim is to have PEDL in every city that Zoomcar has a presence in. Using the cycles is as easy as logging into the app, booking and unlocking a ride using one’s phone. Payments can be made using one of the many wallets that the company has brought on board.', '“Over the next one year, we hope to have PEDL in as many as 30 Indian cities,” says Moran.', '', 'Renting a bicycle through PEDL costs as less as Rs. 10 per half an hour']"

My idea is to make people laugh, have a good time and carry smiles along with them. Stand-up comedy is a medium to tell jokes and if you are able to express your opinion through jokes, it is great but if you can’t do that, there is no need to give an opinion because you have a mic in hand.”', 'How it started', 'A native of Delhi, Angad came to Mumbai to do his business management course and was exposed to stand-up comedy. “I thought I was funny and the first few performances tanked as nobody laughed,” he recalls with a smile. He got a reality check and began preparing for it.

Initially one wants to please the audience. Now I am like I don’t want to do the crowd-pleasing jokes . If something is not funny, I will present it in a way that people will find it funny.”', 'Some stand-up comedians also court controversy when some of their jokes are found offensive by a section of crowd. Angad maintains it is a part and parcel of their job. “A lot of time when one is doing a political commentary, supporters of one party get hurt and allege that another party has been left out. My job is to make jokes.”', 'Happy moments', 'Angad’s happy moment was to find his name among the the top 20 stand-up comedians released by CNN-IBN.

As you gaze at myriad built forms — ranging from aged buildings to lamp posts — you uncover the formal city. As you amble in its lanes, you encounter the informal city. Sometimes it’s in the form of a corner store selling warm bread; occasionally it’s in the form of stray kittens sprawled over a discarded tyre; at times it’s children playing gully cricket and men huddled at the nukkad (corner) for a smoke.', 'But more often than not, especially in a crowded metropolis, what you come across are wandering pedlars and small hawking stands — usually something makeshift, easy to take apart if need be — selling bananas, directing your attention towards a pile of chequered towels, a woman deftly weaving a pile of fragrant mogras into a string, another brewing hot tea and quickly frying a pile of hot bhajiyas for office commuters.', 'These everyday roadside vendors or hawkers, whose presence or absence gives the city a particular character, have recently drawn a lot of attention in Mumbai, as the city comes to terms with the horrific September 29 stampede at Elphinstone Road (local) railway station, resulting in the death of 22 people. After a railway panel of inquiry concluded that rain and an overcrowded narrow staircase/foot overbridge, which had several hawkers, led to the accident, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena activists beat up street vendors and broke up their stalls. Now, the Bombay High Court has ruled that hawking activity should cease near railway stations and footbridges.', 'There may be some merit in this, but clearly, we need to look at the hawkers issue more broadly. For quite some time now, many middle-class citizens groups have urged strict action against hawkers, asking residents not to favour their business. The terms routinely used to refer to hawkers and vendors is “menace”, with their everyday businesses described as “encroachments” on public space.This, despite the fact that an existing 2014 central law, the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, protects their presence as a part of the right to livelihood. The law specifies the number of licensed hawkers permitted and outlines the process to implement a fair street vending policy. Mumbai and other cities have failed to implement the law to date, with the Mumbai municipality having frozen hawker licenses since 1978. As a result, only a fraction of Mumbai’s hawkers are licensed. Hawkers desire legal status — their illegality makes them vulnerable to extortion and harassment by a whole range of State and non-State actors.', 'Unfortunately, by looking upon the hawkers question as only a clearing of pavements issue, we have neglected to see their contribution in several other ways. Firstly, hawkers are not the only ones sullying our pavements. But they are far easier to target as villains than the middle-class who use pavements for car parking and shops/restaurants who unabashedly extend their shopfronts onto footpaths.', 'Secondly, hawking is also an employment issue. It provides the urban poor a means to earn a legitimate livelihood, and in fact, many sell goods produced in small-scale or home-based industries. More interestingly,\nWhy Loiter\n’s gender research shows that contrary to common-sense notions of urban beautification, for women, clean lanes and people-less streets do not equal comfort or safety.

The KUV is all about breaking the norms to bring a fresh perspective to the car buyer. The quirkiness starts all the way on the outside with very cute, but borderline-weird (to the non-millennial) styling. Armed with a plethora of cuts and creases, the KUV looks like a little stuffed-toy-monster. It continues on the inside with the innovative front bench and tonnes of clever storage trays and compartments. The gear lever juts out of the dashboard, which itself has a very clean, functional and simplistic approach to its design. The tall driving position makes puttering around town an absolute breeze. Powering the KUV is an extremely potent 76PS, 1.2-litre, three-pot diesel engine, which combined with the car’s light weight, makes for quite a sprinter! In a nutshell, the KUV100 is an interesting little car targeted at a younger crowd — gently easing them into the SUV lifestyle.', '']"

Hyderabad,"['I learnt driving without even owning a car! It was by fluke. It was during the shooting of my film\nShhh!\nthat I first drove. We were given a rundown van to use for our commute. One day, on a mountaintop, as the day’s shooting was coming to a close, I sat at the wheel for fun, with a friend next to me. All he did was explain where the brake, accelerator and the gear were, and tell me how each worked. Then he said “Start.” That’s it. I started the car, and with shaking knees, began the downward descent. Finally, we came to the bottom of the hill. As I had managed that, I knew I could drive anywhere in the world. It was a thrilling day for me.', 'After that, I did drive other cars for a few years. My experiences with cars have been strange. I never had a car of my own, but drove the ones gifted to me by producers or directors of my films. At other times, I would drive my friend’s cars. I loved driving then, but couldn’t afford them. Ironically, now that I can afford them, I have no time to enjoy them. Today, more than a luxury, it is a necessity. While commuting, I am catching up on correspondence. The first car gifted to me by a producer was a Maruti 1000. Even before I could enjoy that vehicle, it was taken back, as I could not act in his film! Then another producer gifted me a Cielo. It was green in colour. But I never got to enjoy the car because I had so much work those days, writing scripts, directing and acting. All I did was use it as a necessity for my profession. That car was with me for three years, after which I was gifted a Benz. This was during the shooting of my film\nSuper Star\n. Now, I have a Range Rover, which is again a gift. I rarely drive though, any more.', 'As told to Shilpa', 'Sebastian R', '', 'I just sat at the wheel for fun and my friend asked me to drive.

Hyderabad,"['ILF Samanvay, the Indian Languages Festival of New Delhi’s Indian Habitat Centre, has been organising performances and readings of literature from various parts of the world, which have been translated into Indian Languages. Recently, a recitation and interaction was held with eminent Chilean poet, Raúl Zurita. A compilation of his poetry,\nThe Sea of Pain poems\n(1979 – 2016), was launched in Hindi. On this occasion, Raùl Zurita, a man of poetic complexity, recited his poetry in Spanish and shared his thoughts on human suffering.', 'Zurita, 67, a graduate in Civil Engineering and Mathematics, has been composing poems for over four decades now. His work has been concerned with the issue of human suffering — a matter that has been often considered to be the crux of the work of many Latin American writers and poets. But, for Zurita, the point of origin of a poem is quite different when compared to its theme; When I begin to write a poem, I feel happy,” says Zurita, “It is that moment when an idea turns itself into an expression.”', 'Zurita’s magnum opus would have to be the trilogy, “Purgatorio”(1979), “Anteparaiso”(1982) and “La Vida Nueva”(1993). Having begun the work right at the threshold of his prolific career as a poet, the trilogy covers a stretch of three decades of rumination. If one were to pick this trilogy for a personal read or a recitation, it wouldn’t take much for one to realise the iconoclastic approach made by Zurita to the oft-considered-necessary metrics of form, meter and rhyme; he observes no such rules which have been perennially used to gauge the poetic sensibility of a poet.', 'It leads to the obvious question: why not use a form, meter? “Meter is tradition,” Zurita begins, “Now-a-days, it is a necessity to not measure our expressions. In these times, we must liberate expression.” Before he closes, the next question erupts: from where did these notions arise? “I was a student of Architecture and Mathematics,” he replies, “and in Mathematics I discovered the beauty of allowing things to flow as they desire, as they solve themselves.” He adds further, as he grows reminiscent of the days of his life as a student at University, “I had a teacher, his words still ring in my mind: One should not simply follow tradition like a beast.”', 'Zurita, who received the Chilean National Prize for Literature, has witnessed his works being translated into English, German, Bengali, Hindi, Italian, Chinese, Greek and Slovenian. Furthermore, he prefers to divide his interest in poetry, or poets to be precise, on the basis of two types of readings; “If I seek inspiration, I read Walt Whitman. And, if I seek pleasure and wish to sit and admire, I read Pablo Neruda,” shares Zurita.', '“The Sea of Pain”, the eponymous poem of the compilation, acts as a requiem and memorabilia simultaneously for the Syrian immigrants that died trying to save their lives. Although the title may suggest the Pain and the Sea as symbols of a grander cataclysm, Zurita’s thoughts behind its conception tell otherwise; “I had no clue in the beginning of what I wished to communicate. And, I must make it clear that I don’t believe in symbols or representations, I believe in the thing itself,” he continues, “This poem does not represent anything. It simply tells that Aman Kurdi’s brother, Ghalib, has no photo that shall tell people of his suffering — about the loss of his life. Similarly, there are thousands of other Syrian children that died and shall never be known to the world. I write for them.” The final lines of the poem, as translated by Aparajit Chattopadhyay, read his thoughts clearly; “I am not his father, / but Ghalib Khurdi is my son.”', '“Poetry is hope for things which do not have any hope,” Zurita voices his thoughts of poetry, “poetry is love for those that do not have love. Poetry is beyond any language.” His age has resulted in the ripening of his ideas on the subject as well as contributed in rendering him and his work steadfast. He believes that today his work only aims or rather expects nothing from this world but peace. So, then, does he expect his poems to act remedial to the suffering of people? “Suffering can only be seen, all balms are futile,” Zurita responds almost instantly, “In the vast sea of suffering, remedies are simply a grain of sand.”', 'With a sense of precision in his eyes, and alluding to, one of his own favorite poets, Jorge Luis Borges’ “Resist! Resist! Resist!” message to young poets, Raùl Zurita says, “Effort! Effort! Effort!” is all that young poets of today must make.']"

The project is being established on the lines of the national-level de-addiction institute to come up at the Kinaloor industrial estate in Kozhikode.', '“The core aim of the centre, to be operated with the support of professionals trained in de-addiction programmes, is to clear the stigma attached to seeking de-addiction treatment. As the law requires minor victims to be treated as outpatients in hospitals, parents often hesitate to treat their children, and this should be changed,” said K.A. Nelson, Divisional Deputy Excise Commissioner, Ernakulam.', 'Similarly, parents also need a guided understanding on identifying a child’s psyche. “There have been instances in which some parents simply refused to accept the mental health condition of their children and charged us of mistreatment,” he said.', 'According to him, Marijuana is the most popular illegal drug and youths in the 15 to 20 age group are the most vulnerable. For instance, the Excise Department alone seized about 7.5 kilograms of ganja and booked 60 cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act in October this year. In the previous month, it seized about 17.5 kilograms of ganja and booked over 100 cases in this connection.', 'Besides the Excise, the police have also booked around 1,200 cases for drug abuse and peddling.', '“Most of the arrested were addicts who eventually become peddlers, and they make others addicts too.

It is impossible to see anything outside, but the heaviness in the air indicates thick vegetation and high humidity. The driver, a local Javanese, talks non-stop to about a dozen of his passengers, perhaps in an attempt to keep them awake. But then none of us have come so far to sleep.', 'The Buddhist temple of Borobudur lies 40 kilometres off the town of Yogyakarta. Nobody knows who built it or why; studies suggest that it was constructed sometime in the 9th Century, perhaps to establish the supremacy of the religion. The temple however was abandoned soon after and lay hidden under dense forests and volcanic ashes for centuries, until it was discovered by a British surveyor in 1814. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991. But, as the driver said, it still remains relatively unknown.', 'Layers of philosophy', 'It is still dark when we arrive at a resort close to the temple. A bright reception welcomes us and a lady promptly hands over torches to everyone — we are supposed to walk the rest of the distance. “This temple is built to represent multiple layers of Buddhist theory. From a bird’s eye view, the temple is in the shape of a Buddhist mandala: a square with four entry points and a circular centre point. The three zones of consciousness are represented in the circles and the central sphere represents unconsciousness or Nirvana,” the guide tells us, as we try to find our feet amidst darkness and moist earth. The walk is long, and there are nine levels to climb. Borobudur is not a single unit, but a wide complex built with black volcanic rocks. The top storey is embellished with more than 73 pagodas, each encasing an idol of Buddha; the walls around the other levels meanwhile are adorned with murals — some influenced by the Indian version of the Buddha’s story, some uniquely Indonesian — and more idols of the Buddha in various poses. The mural count around these levels stands at a massive 2,652 and the total number of Buddhas is 505. While the uniqueness of the temple lies in the pagodas and the richly carved walls, watching the sun rise from the summit remains the most famous activity here. At 4.30 am, people are already waiting on the summit armed with their cameras and tripods.', 'As the horizon begins to get brighter, faint silhouettes begin to appear.

Chennai,"['Durdle Door, Hříměždice, Treyarnon Bay... Owen Weymouth’s Instagram feed, other than inducing serious wanderlust, also serves as a geography class of sorts, introducing followers to unheard-of locales. Every other post has exotic locations, made even more appealing, accompanied by photographs of him leaping off treacherous cliffs. Weymouth is a cliff diver based in Plymouth, United Kingdom. “I currently hold World High Diving Federation titles of European Champion 2016 and Greek International Open 2017. I am also the youngest male diver in the Red Bull Cliff Diving world series, and I am part of the Great Britain senior men’s team for high diving,” says the 18-year-old.', '', 'Around the globe', 'His profession takes him places — 40 cities as of now, and counting. From Wadi Shab of Oman in the middle of the desert and The Azores Islands in the middle of the Atlantic, to Chile and bustling cities such as Copenhagen, La Rochelle and Boston, his passport is full. Other than the opportunity to discover new places, what appeals to Weymouth about the sport is “the personal challenge of the discipline. In traditional diving, there is a limit to what divers can do. The maximum drop is 10 metres and therefore some manoeuvres become impossible, whereas in cliff diving we have 27 metres and the complexity of skills and possibilities become greater with increased airtime,” says Weymouth. What keeps him going is the feeling of overcoming a great challenge. “After completing a successful dive, your body is already pumping with adrenaline and when you know you are safe in the water the feeling is truly euphoric,” he adds.', 'Weymouth was initially into springboard and platform diving. In 2010, on a family holiday in Mallorca, Spain, he tried his first cliff dive. “The worst part is the way you feel just before the dive. In such a dangerous discipline, it is natural to doubt your ability, and you will be scared of a bad landing that can cause extreme injury. I do breathing exercises and mental visualisation of dives in order to relax. Before I leap I try to forget about my surroundings and turn my brain on autopilot.” Weymouth’s most dangerous dive happened in Croatia, where along with fellow cliff diver Ellie Smart, he set up The Clean Cliffs Project. They make short films about plastic pollution that’s affecting the seas and the oceans. Through these videos, they inspire people to take action. “We were on a boat discovering the Croatian Islands for our first project, and we came to a beautiful horseshoe-shaped cliff made of limestone. There was one take-off point which looked amazing, and we measured it to be 32 metres, which is an extra five metres on top of the professional competition height of 27 metres. The impact is so much stronger and therefore dangerous. I hit the water at roughly 63-65mph. Even with my perfectly vertical entry into the water, the impact felt like a huge car crash,” he narrates.', 'The sport, though fraught with danger, provides an adrenaline high. It’s perhaps the feeling of letting go and feeling like a bird, that adds to the appeal. Despite being an extreme sport, cliff diving is attracting a lot of interest. Places such as Buza Bar in Dubrovnik, Kamari Beach (Santorini), Ao Tanot Bay (Koh Tao) among others, get tourists who come with the intention of diving off intimidating cliffs into the cool blue waters. “Unfortunately, there is a lot of negative press because some divers do not take the safety precautions necessary and injuries and fatalities do happen,” says Weymouth, and adds, “For anybody who wants to dive, follow these vital steps. Check the depth of the water; it should be at least four metres deep. Make sure your friends are in the water ready to help you out in case of an injury. And when it comes to height, the most important point is to gradually work your way up. It is extremely dangerous to jump from higher than 40 feet if you have no previous experience. Bad landings can cause serious injuries from greater heights, so be sensible and don’t make a decision that you will regret.”', 'The diver is pleased that even professionally, the sport is becoming bigger. Since the Red Bull Cliff Diving Series started in 2009, the standard of diving has increased dramatically, he says. “The divers are now performing tricks which would have been considered impossible 10-15 years ago. Since 2013, it has also become a professional sport for women. I earned around £5,000 in 2017, my first year of professional cliff diving. However, the full series divers earn around £15,000-£30,000 in prize money, with the very top guys making up to £50-60K. It is not much compared to the elite athletes of other sports, but as publicity and popularity increases, I can only imagine prize money increasing in the future,” says Weymouth.', '', 'Weymouth’s top picks to cliff dive', 'Amalfi Coast, Italy', 'Greek Islands of Crete and Zante', 'The Old Bridge in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'Islands of Croatia', 'Polignano a Mare, Italy', '', 'Taking the plunge', 'Cliff diving dates back to the1700s, when King Kahekili of Hawaii challenged his warriors to perfect the art of ‘Lele Kawa’, meaning to jump from a great height into the water without making a splash.']"

That was when he saw her: a woman rising from the earth, balancing a load of clay on her head and drenched in sweat.', '“She looked like a sculpture silhouetted against the morning sun, a Chola bronze Parvathi. Her skin was dark and shiny, her limbs were perfect, she moved with easy grace,” says Goud, adding with a chuckle. “I have great admiration for the female form.”', 'The female form does inhabit much of his work: voluptuous, earthy, sensual and often accompanied by the goat, a symbol of both phallicism and bucolicism. “People say that I am obsessed with the erotic. So? What is so vulgar about it? Don’t we worship beautiful, female deities?” smiles Goud, who is in the city with an exhibition of his paintings, prints, drawings and sculptures created over 60 years, titled ‘An Inner Retrospective’.', 'While the erotic is indeed a recurrent theme, what is perhaps more striking is his sense of identity. The rustic is not just captured in his work, it is celebrated. “Art has to go back to its roots, otherwise it will never attract you,” he says. He evokes the metaphor of a tree here, and remarks, “Because I held onto my roots, it took the shape of a trunk and branched out. I am much stronger because of that.”', 'He pooh-poohs the notion that art and craft are two separate entities; one hinged on skill and legacy, the other a creative expression of thoughts, emotions and experiences. Referring to the Bauhaus art school in Germany that tried to peel off the line between artisanism and creativity, he says, “I have always believed that a potter is an artist, a carpenter is an artist, a barber is an artist. How can we forget our trades? By going to an art school and studying for four-five years, we have not become supreme beings.”', 'The artist awakens', 'K Laxma Goud was born in 1940 in Nizampur, 60-70 kms from Hyderabad, presently in Telangana district, to an agrarian family. “We were five brothers and my father worked in the Revenue Department,” he says. It was a small village, with only a primary school, while “for high school we had to come down to the district,” says Goud, but “it was alive.”', 'The village didn’t just raise a child, it created an artist. Those early years were a great influence on his work, he says, sharing fond memories of the\nbhagotham\nor street theatre that offered a vibrant, music-and-movement-punctuated presentation of the epics. “When you have a fertile imagination, you appreciate all these things. To begin with, it is nothing but curiosity. And then that very curiosity leads to the finding of oneself,” he says.', 'His family probably didn’t understand his art completely, he says, but they were always supportive.', '“My father was thrilled that I could draw. It was because of him that I went to art school,” says Goud, confessing to drawing on walls at school.', 'He went on to complete a Diploma in Drawing and Painting from the Government College of Fine Arts, Hyderabad, before moving to Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda.', 'It was here that he met his mentor, KG Subramanyan, one of the leading contemporary artists of post-Independent India.', 'It was Subramanyan who found promise in the young Goud, recognising his draughtsmanship, encouraging him to explore drawing, instead of emulating the colourful paintings of his contemporaries.', '“‘Who told you that only colourful paintings make you an artist?’, he told me,” recalls Goud. “Whatever little intellect and thinking I have, comes from him.”', 'The Midas touch', '“Art is not big because it has money. It is because it is original, and after the artist, there is nothing,” says Goud. And while art doesn’t change society, it widens its vision and contributes to the idea of change.', 'As with any artist, the long road between being and becoming was strewn with hardship, sacrifice, loss. “I was born when progressive painters were established, but they were also struggling,” he says, adding that understanding his identity, medium and language of expression was a long-drawn-out process.', 'Not everyone appreciated it. The initial years were hard: galleries rejected him and people didn’t want to accept his work even as a gift, recalls Goud, who also later set up the Sarojini Naidu School of Performing Arts, Fine Arts and Communication (he retired as Dean in 2001).', '“There was this woman who came to my show in Hyderabad, walked patiently around the gallery, and then told my best friend that I should be sent to an asylum,” he grins.', 'He takes it in his stride, pointing out that despite the initial flak, he fought the good fight and succeeded.

Chennai,"['Putting pen to paperC Douglas with some of his worksSpecial arrangement', 'The compact gallery at InKo Centre is packed with admirers of artist C Douglas; they’ve come to see his show Blind Poet and Butterflies presented in conjunction with DakshinaChitra. The white walls are lined with a series of exquisite artworks, 30 of which are small format works and one large mixed media. The series explores the evanescent butterfly to speak of the human condition — in one, a man is sunk in contemplation on a table and in another a butterfly spreads its wings across a man’s chest. Curiously small, but extraordinarily detailed, the drawings are testimony to Douglas’s control of pen, ink and paper. They are accompanied by Korean Zen poems printed on card, some selected by Douglas from a volume he bought online, and others contributed by Rathi Jafer, director, InKo Centre.', 'Blind Poet and Butterflies has taken many forms earlier: Douglas’ oeuvre is a continual evolution of concepts. Steeped in Camus and TS Eliot, some find his approach intellectual; which he disagrees with. “Mine is a philosophic theoretical discourse. The Madras School works were figural (a term borrowed from Francis Bacon) — between abstract and figurative, informal and lyrical.”', 'Central to the Madras Movement — of which Douglas has been a part since the 1970s when he came to Chennai from Kerala — is the use of words in painting. Douglas quotes KCS Paniker, who spearheaded the Movement, “I am not going to paint my paintings any more. I am going to write my paintings.” Written paintings are a special characteristic of the Madras School, says Douglas, adding, “We also place more emphasis on myth and nostalgia unlike intellectuals who maintain a distance from their work.” He chooses to paint on rough scraps rather than on fine quality paper. Words find their way into places like the edges of paper napkins following a ‘stream of consciousness.’ Things are not where they are supposed to be and we have the sensation of being dislocated. Through these ambiguities, it is the personalised quality of Douglas’ imagery that invites us endearingly: to examine intricate patterns, a slightly skewed table leg, bits of torn brown edges from a spiral bind and vivid blue inky textures. Again and again, they tug at our emotions from unexpected quarters.', 'American travel writer Paul Theroux writes about being a stranger in places where he travels, experiencing a sense of otherness and wonders if it is not a condition of every human being. I ask Douglas if his engagements with absence and loss relate to this continuous pull between home and being elsewhere? Douglas counters me saying he has found his place. “In fact, when I came in 1971, I felt as if Cholamandal, Paniker and my teachers were all waiting for me.”', 'As for his stay in Germany in the 1980s, Douglas says in a sense he had already migrated. “I was reading Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Hemingway and TS Eliot. Already, when we are young there is an internal migration.” With his love for Rimbaud’s\nThe Drunken Boat\n, dreamlike renditions and unexpected juxtaposition of objects and hollow body parts, the connect to Dada and Surrealism is undeniable. Yet, by taking the middle path, Douglas has bypassed the route of hyper-reality. The Zen Koans alongside his works at the gallery play further on these ideas of absurdity and impermanence. Blind poet and butterflies bring a fortuitous union, a communion — the poet spins verses and the butterfly has eyes on its wings that let the poet see. When opposites encounter each other in Douglas’ language, ambivalence is the result.', 'The show is on at InKo Centre till December 2.', '', 'Paper love', 'Douglas’ large works combine carefully crumpled paper and sand affixed with resin over which he draws and paints with pen and ink. He likes paper as a medium as its ephemeral quality compares to all of life.', 'Coffee and art', 'The 30 works in this show were produced in one-and-a-half months at Douglas’ kitchen table over endless cups of coffee and late nights.', 'At the event', 'Gita’s film\nBlack Mirror\n, shot from 2011 to 2016, visually paraphrases Douglas’ self-styled way of working and features interviews with critic MD Muthukumaraswamy and senior artist K Muralidharan.']"

Tucked away in the lap of Nature and serenity, Araku is known for its pristine valleys, cultural heritage, stunning waterfalls gushing out of the hills and coffee plantations.', 'Atiqah adds, “This beautiful piece of jewel is such a discovery for balloon pilots.

Each balloonist has two radio sets — one for the pilot and the other for the staff below. While I find myself immersed in the magical scenes unfolding before me, Atiqah gets ready to land and sends a message from her radio set. “The most different way to fly a hot air balloon is to fly low and the most challenging part is to get a deal landing,” says the confident young pilot. By now, the winds have again picked up pace. Beneath us, there are just fields of yellow niger fields. As she prepares for the final part of the landing, I can sense a slight anxiety in her voice. “We are heading for a bit of an adventurous landing this time. Just hold on!” she instructs.', 'While I tightly fix myself to the corner of the basket, the balloon makes quite a strong impact on the field as we hit the ground. For a second, my heart is in my mouth. Within seconds, my anxiety meets the curious, excited faces of the villagers from the neighbouring tribal hamlet who run towards us to greet us with a warm hello. “This is the best part of ballooning.

After Independence, The Ashok was the first structure of that scale to come up, and it is unmatched even today,” says Dutt.', 'The Ashok is built on a part of Raisina Hill with the contours of the land incorporated beautifully in the architecture. The lobby is almost two levels above the ground, whereas one of the restaurants and convention area are at ground level.', 'The original drawings of the hotel in the GM’s room also show a tall tower, which somehow got subdued in the final design. Dutt describes how India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, personally supervised the construction of the hotel, riding on horseback around the estate.', 'Nehru wanted a really big lavish hotel constructed to accommodate UNESCO delegates in 1956, and he requested help from several royals to achieve his dream. While Karan Singh donated the land, several other princes chipped in with funds.', 'Fifteen of the 23 original shareholders of The Ashoka Hotels, the company that was absorbed into ITDC, were royal princes.', 'What’s nice about The Ashok is that unlike most other ITDC properties that are decaying with neglect — the Janpath in Delhi is a case in point, though it has been handed over to the Urban Development Ministry — this property is periodically refurbished and re-invented. And though ITDC is now on a selling spree, insiders say, this is one property that the Government will never divest.', '', 'During the Commonwealth Games in 2010, Rs. 70 crore was pumped into the hotel.

For instance, he pulls out a ledger from 1958 to show me who stayed at the hotel that year.

The designer is working on a new project now. “It’s titled ‘Duality’, a project that we have been working on for several months now. We are creating something that does not conform to gender roles. While exploring the theme of androgyny, the natural choice was to make something gender neutral or unisex,” says Theagrajan. As a result, Indie Culture recently launched their first unisex piece of clothing — a suede jacket. The jacket is hand-embroidered by artisans in Kochi and cut and sewn in Chennai. It has ribbed sleeves and a waistband that gives it a sporty look. “Keeping in line with the theme of self-expression, we give you the option of custom-designing a selection of colours and embroideries,” she adds.', 'There are a lot of stereotypes, with even small things like associating pink with girls and suits with men, she says. “Why would you want to believe what is assigned to you as final? It is definitely okay for a man to wear a flowery jacket. You don’t have to be stereotyped on your freedom of comfort. This is to tell that there needn’t be any labels outside to describe you,” she says. The project is a collaboration with illustrator Vishnu Valsan, her classmate from NIFT, stylist Aarya Maria Mathai and photographer Shani Shaki. Theagrajan believes that unisex clothing was and still is prevalent in a lot of traditional Indian clothing and performance art costumes. Garments like the Kerala mundu, loose skirts, kurtas and Patialas, among others, have been known to be worn by both men and women for decades, she says. “Questioning gender roles and stereotypes is an important trend that has gained prominence over the last few years. We begin to see that this has had a lot of positive influence over society as a whole. I believe this conversation has resulted in the rise of gender neutral or unisex fashion the world over,” says Theagrajan.', 'While creating unisex clothing, it is important to keep in mind the size, shape and silhouette of the garment, for it to be comfortable for all. “It requires a good understanding of pattern-making and the movement of the human form,” says the 25-year-old.

If you prefer exercising your limbs, hire a bike and explore the town like Anushka Sharma did in\nPK\n. Remember to stop by a bookshop, and pause for delicious hot chocolate. Along the way, discover houses that have defined Bruges since the Middle Ages, listen to the tales behind their tiny windows, and marvel at the beauty of this UNESCO World Heritage City. End your day at one of the many Michelin-starred restaurants. Choose from delicacies like horse steak, eel in herb sauce, and tongue set in gelatin, or play it safe with stew or mussels and mushroom.']"

Nobody knows who built it or why; studies suggest that it was constructed sometime in the 9th Century, perhaps to establish the supremacy of the religion. The temple however was abandoned soon after and lay hidden under dense forests and volcanic ashes for centuries, until it was discovered by a British surveyor in 1814. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991.

The top storey is embellished with more than 73 pagodas, each encasing an idol of Buddha; the walls around the other levels meanwhile are adorned with murals — some influenced by the Indian version of the Buddha’s story, some uniquely Indonesian — and more idols of the Buddha in various poses. The mural count around these levels stands at a massive 2,652 and the total number of Buddhas is 505.

Weymouth is a cliff diver based in Plymouth, United Kingdom. “I currently hold World High Diving Federation titles of European Champion 2016 and Greek International Open 2017. I am also the youngest male diver in the Red Bull Cliff Diving world series, and I am part of the Great Britain senior men’s team for high diving,” says the 18-year-old.', '', 'Around the globe', 'His profession takes him places — 40 cities as of now, and counting. From Wadi Shab of Oman in the middle of the desert and The Azores Islands in the middle of the Atlantic, to Chile and bustling cities such as Copenhagen, La Rochelle and Boston, his passport is full. Other than the opportunity to discover new places, what appeals to Weymouth about the sport is “the personal challenge of the discipline. In traditional diving, there is a limit to what divers can do. The maximum drop is 10 metres and therefore some manoeuvres become impossible, whereas in cliff diving we have 27 metres and the complexity of skills and possibilities become greater with increased airtime,” says Weymouth. What keeps him going is the feeling of overcoming a great challenge. “After completing a successful dive, your body is already pumping with adrenaline and when you know you are safe in the water the feeling is truly euphoric,” he adds.', 'Weymouth was initially into springboard and platform diving. In 2010, on a family holiday in Mallorca, Spain, he tried his first cliff dive. “The worst part is the way you feel just before the dive. In such a dangerous discipline, it is natural to doubt your ability, and you will be scared of a bad landing that can cause extreme injury. I do breathing exercises and mental visualisation of dives in order to relax. Before I leap I try to forget about my surroundings and turn my brain on autopilot.” Weymouth’s most dangerous dive happened in Croatia, where along with fellow cliff diver Ellie Smart, he set up The Clean Cliffs Project. They make short films about plastic pollution that’s affecting the seas and the oceans. Through these videos, they inspire people to take action. “We were on a boat discovering the Croatian Islands for our first project, and we came to a beautiful horseshoe-shaped cliff made of limestone. There was one take-off point which looked amazing, and we measured it to be 32 metres, which is an extra five metres on top of the professional competition height of 27 metres. The impact is so much stronger and therefore dangerous. I hit the water at roughly 63-65mph. Even with my perfectly vertical entry into the water, the impact felt like a huge car crash,” he narrates.', 'The sport, though fraught with danger, provides an adrenaline high. It’s perhaps the feeling of letting go and feeling like a bird, that adds to the appeal. Despite being an extreme sport, cliff diving is attracting a lot of interest. Places such as Buza Bar in Dubrovnik, Kamari Beach (Santorini), Ao Tanot Bay (Koh Tao) among others, get tourists who come with the intention of diving off intimidating cliffs into the cool blue waters. “Unfortunately, there is a lot of negative press because some divers do not take the safety precautions necessary and injuries and fatalities do happen,” says Weymouth, and adds, “For anybody who wants to dive, follow these vital steps. Check the depth of the water; it should be at least four metres deep. Make sure your friends are in the water ready to help you out in case of an injury. And when it comes to height, the most important point is to gradually work your way up. It is extremely dangerous to jump from higher than 40 feet if you have no previous experience. Bad landings can cause serious injuries from greater heights, so be sensible and don’t make a decision that you will regret.”', 'The diver is pleased that even professionally, the sport is becoming bigger. Since the Red Bull Cliff Diving Series started in 2009, the standard of diving has increased dramatically, he says. “The divers are now performing tricks which would have been considered impossible 10-15 years ago. Since 2013, it has also become a professional sport for women. I earned around £5,000 in 2017, my first year of professional cliff diving. However, the full series divers earn around £15,000-£30,000 in prize money, with the very top guys making up to £50-60K. It is not much compared to the elite athletes of other sports, but as publicity and popularity increases, I can only imagine prize money increasing in the future,” says Weymouth.', '', 'Weymouth’s top picks to cliff dive', 'Amalfi Coast, Italy', 'Greek Islands of Crete and Zante', 'The Old Bridge in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'Islands of Croatia', 'Polignano a Mare, Italy', '', 'Taking the plunge', 'Cliff diving dates back to the1700s, when King Kahekili of Hawaii challenged his warriors to perfect the art of ‘Lele Kawa’, meaning to jump from a great height into the water without making a splash.']"

The initiation for the show titled ‘Nouveau 8x12’’ is a video installation, inside a large hall, by Laxman Aelay that juxtaposes a calming abstract thrown on a wall against the chaotic arrangements of sticks, stones and cobwebs in harsh blue light. “I wanted to show how demonetisation and GST have upended lives,” says Aelay.', 'The exhibition continues in two other halls where the art works challenge you to step up close to see the skill of the artist or step back in awe and size it up.

More than a decade and a half. But can’t miss him from a distance, robust at 55, still trim and fit, a throwback to the younger days when he presented a majestic sight at many an equestrian meet in the Capital. In later years, he emerged one of the finest polo players you can imagine.', 'Adhiraj must be singularly credited with the popularity of polo. But he disagrees. “None can match my uncles (RS `Pickles’ Sodhi and Billy Sodhi),” is his modest response. It is a proud polo family. “My mother has four Arjuna Award winners in her family. Brothers and sons (myself and Mansher).”', 'We are meeting for lunch at the Oudh in The Ashok. Adhiraj has a busy life. He promotes the sport and organises competitions. “I just love it,” he quips. One can understand why. He was born to become a skilful horseman.', 'Adhiraj nods as the chef offers “salted nimboo-soda.” In fact, Adhiraj soaks in the Nawabi ambience of the restaurant, very tastefully done with paintings depicting the period and the kings. “I am pleasantly surprised at the wonderful décor,” he mumbles.', 'It was “fascination” and “passion” that drove Adhiraj to equestrian sport. His motivation came from his uncles and he chose to join the army for this very reason. “I joined National Defence Academy (NDA) because army patronised equestrian. I couldn’t have afforded to pursue my love for horses on my own. I am grateful that army gave me the platform.”', 'A bronze in the team event at the 1986 Seoul Asian Games was a hard-earned honour. “I had trained for the Games. It is not about riding a horse. You have to control and guide the animal. Equestrian is so different from polo. Equestrian is individual and in polo you are co-ordinating with your partners. Polo requires different skills altogether. Talent matters but what really counts is perseverance,” remarks Adhiraj.', 'The buffet spread is enticing. Obviously, our guest surveys the offerings and settles down to a mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian lunch. “My breakfast is mostly eggs but my lunch is always heavy. I restrict dinner to mostly soup,” Adhiraj explains his eating habits.', 'He enjoys his lunch. “I’ll have a bit of meat and chicken now. My diet is 90 per cent vegetarian. I eat to live and not live to eat. Of course, I appreciate good food. I like Italian and French food too.” Adhiraj helps himself to some dal, biryani, a little bit of mutton, sweet potato and pumpkin.', '“Polo,” Adhiraj explains, “is a dangerous sport. But tremendously exciting. The horse has to follow your instructions even as you balance yourself and combine with your partners. The pace can be scorching and injuries crippling. But I can’t live without polo.” He has survived severe neck and facial injuries without ever thinking of quitting because of the risks that come from the sport.', 'Egalitarian spirit', '', 'Adhiraj is happy that polo is not the domain of royals and army anymore. “Most polo players today are from middle class background. It’s an obsession for them to be associated with the horses. They have found access to it. You have to find access to polo for the game to grow and I must say it has.”', 'The polo star points out the busy polo season to drive home his point. “The polo season has grown. It is in a healthier phase today than it has been for a very long time. It was booming in the 1990s and then it went down. But it is looking very good now. The stock market crash had impacted it because polo is considered a luxury sport. Now it is again picking up in a big way. Lot of young people are getting into it. People are importing horses.”', 'For a rider, a good horse is the key. “Quality of horses has to be outstanding. Racing horses have to be bred here but polo horses can be imported. The fully trained come at a cost but so many polo players importing horses I am sure the mindset has changed. They are not hesitating to spend money to meet their targets.”', 'In Adhiraj’s opinion, India has a decent infrastructure for conducting polo events.', '“The sport has survived because of some iconic polo grounds – Jaipur Polo ground and Mahalaxmi Race Course (Mumbai). The game has been alive because of these grounds and more polo grounds and polo stables are coming up now. There are more sponsors coming to promote it. Big brands associating with polo is a healthy sign.” The polo season, lasting from September to March, includes 30 to 40 tournaments all over the country with Delhi and Jaipur hosting the most.', ""“I have played everywhere in the world. Australia, America, Europe, England, South America, Argentina. The only big polo nation where I haven't played in is South Africa,” says Adhiraj, who is associated with the sport in many roles. He is on a few committees of the Indian Polo Association apart from being a National selector."", '“I continue to play an active role because of my knowledge and experience. I also contribute through my company. We do Indian Open and Indian Masters.”', 'The chef offers “Noore chasm.” It’s a digestive drink. As Adhiraj sips, I ask him if he follows other sports. “My passion (for polo) has become work now. Polo has been the driving force for me. It is exhilarating and addictive. The animal does most of the critical work. But you have a big role too. I love sports. Like most Indians, I enjoy cricket, but I watch swimming, badminton, wrestling. I can’t watch India lose at hockey.”', 'A polo meeting beckons him. As we part, Adhiraj extends an invitation to watch some polo matches this season.

Still it is not the largest hotel in the world. That honour belongs to the First World Hotel at Genting Highlands in Malaysia, which has 7,351 rooms and overtook The Venetian in 2015.', 'In India, anything over 500 rooms is considered massive. We may be a country of over a billion people, but operate on entirely different scales when it comes to hotels. Most five-star properties hover around 200 rooms or so, and there are plenty of boutique properties with just 50 to 70 rooms. Real estate prices are a barrier to thinking big. Also, it’s not easy selling so many rooms in India.', 'However, the entry of foreign chains has been changing things, with some mega-sized Grand Hyatts coming up all over the country. In terms of rooms and meeting space, Renaissance in Powai, Mumbai, is probably one of the largest in the country at present. The exploding MICE (meetings, incentives, conventions and expositions) opportunity is now leading to some big properties being developed, though still under the 1,000 mark.', 'For a very long time, The Ashok Hotel in Delhi and the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai were neck and neck in terms of being India’s largest hotels by rooms, until the ITC Grand Chola in Chennai overtook them, with over 600 rooms.', 'But in terms of sprawl — it is spread over 25 acres — nobody really can come close to the Government-owned The Ashok in Delhi, which also has some riveting history to it. “It’s the first five-star hotel built in independent India,” says Vijay Dutt, general manager of The Ashok, as he pulls out some fascinating drawings that show the construction of this palatial edifice.', '“The Parliament House, North Block, South Block… all came up pre-Independence. After Independence, The Ashok was the first structure of that scale to come up, and it is unmatched even today,” says Dutt.', 'The Ashok is built on a part of Raisina Hill with the contours of the land incorporated beautifully in the architecture. The lobby is almost two levels above the ground, whereas one of the restaurants and convention area are at ground level.', 'The original drawings of the hotel in the GM’s room also show a tall tower, which somehow got subdued in the final design. Dutt describes how India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, personally supervised the construction of the hotel, riding on horseback around the estate. Nehru wanted a really big lavish hotel constructed to accommodate UNESCO delegates in 1956, and he requested help from several royals to achieve his dream. While Karan Singh donated the land, several other princes chipped in with funds.', 'Fifteen of the 23 original shareholders of The Ashoka Hotels, the company that was absorbed into ITDC, were royal princes.', 'What’s nice about The Ashok is that unlike most other ITDC properties that are decaying with neglect — the Janpath in Delhi is a case in point, though it has been handed over to the Urban Development Ministry — this property is periodically refurbished and re-invented. And though ITDC is now on a selling spree, insiders say, this is one property that the Government will never divest.', '', 'During the Commonwealth Games in 2010, Rs. 70 crore was pumped into the hotel. Dutt shares how more rooms for differently-abled were added then, making it the hotel with the most number of accessible rooms in the Capital.', 'Dutt, who has spent over 30 years with ITDC, is a loving custodian of The Ashok, sharing the history of the hotel with great passion. For instance, he pulls out a ledger from 1958 to show me who stayed at the hotel that year. Most guests appear to be foreigners, though there are several film stars from Bombay too, with Sunil Dutt’s name popping up prominently.', 'It’s perhaps good that the GM is a runner (he runs half marathons), as a daily round of the complex covers tens of thousands of steps. Just imagine, it takes 1,000 employees and Rs. 35 lakh to run the hotel daily. It’s been a good year, says Dutt, with over 60% average occupancy. “To fill a 550-room hotel is not easy. Yet, we had 330 rooms occupied year around,” he says. It’s easier to sell rooms when there is a conference, he adds. Scale does come with monumental challenges!', 'The writer is an editorial consultant withBusiness Linewho writes on consumer behaviour but keeps an interested gaze at the travel and hospitality sector', '', 'India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru personally supervised the construction of the hotel, riding on horseback around the estate']"

So how do you strike a balance?', '', 'Narresh:\nUnfortunately, there is a very fine line while designing for or dressing children. Our philosophy in regards to kidswear is to keep it simple. We have stuck with a colour palette that is fun and whimsical and spiffed it up with fun geometrical motifs that children can easily relate to. Silhouettes have been kept effortless, with comfort being the utmost focus.', 'Should we make children conscious of clothes, and at what age?', '', ""Shivan:\nWith social media being at the centre of everything we do today, it is virtually impossible to limit their exposure to fashion and trends. However, kids don't need to be made conscious of brands at an early age. Children should be encouraged to express themselves via their clothes, but the brands they wear shouldn't necessarily be at the forefront."", 'Is kidswear an international phenomenon?', '', 'Narresh:\nVery much so. For years now, celebrity children have been scrutinised for their outfits, which has resulted isn them being decked out in the finest clothes that are on offer in the market. Luxury brands have tapped into this demand, and this phenomenon has trickled down to India as well.', 'Is there a specialisation required in kidswear?', '', ""Shivan:\nThe kidswear category has gained popularity with an unmatched momentum, and has long surpassed women’s wear and men’s wear.

Tourists usually go to Bali, Ubud, or Surabaya; in fact, very few know about Borobudur at all.” It is 3.30 am and we are driving on a dark narrow road towards the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Borobudur. It is impossible to see anything outside, but the heaviness in the air indicates thick vegetation and high humidity. The driver, a local Javanese, talks non-stop to about a dozen of his passengers, perhaps in an attempt to keep them awake. But then none of us have come so far to sleep.', 'The Buddhist temple of Borobudur lies 40 kilometres off the town of Yogyakarta. Nobody knows who built it or why; studies suggest that it was constructed sometime in the 9th Century, perhaps to establish the supremacy of the religion. The temple however was abandoned soon after and lay hidden under dense forests and volcanic ashes for centuries, until it was discovered by a British surveyor in 1814. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991. But, as the driver said, it still remains relatively unknown.', 'Layers of philosophy', 'It is still dark when we arrive at a resort close to the temple. A bright reception welcomes us and a lady promptly hands over torches to everyone — we are supposed to walk the rest of the distance. “This temple is built to represent multiple layers of Buddhist theory. From a bird’s eye view, the temple is in the shape of a Buddhist mandala: a square with four entry points and a circular centre point. The three zones of consciousness are represented in the circles and the central sphere represents unconsciousness or Nirvana,” the guide tells us, as we try to find our feet amidst darkness and moist earth. The walk is long, and there are nine levels to climb. Borobudur is not a single unit, but a wide complex built with black volcanic rocks. The top storey is embellished with more than 73 pagodas, each encasing an idol of Buddha; the walls around the other levels meanwhile are adorned with murals — some influenced by the Indian version of the Buddha’s story, some uniquely Indonesian — and more idols of the Buddha in various poses. The mural count around these levels stands at a massive 2,652 and the total number of Buddhas is 505. While the uniqueness of the temple lies in the pagodas and the richly carved walls, watching the sun rise from the summit remains the most famous activity here. At 4.30 am, people are already waiting on the summit armed with their cameras and tripods.', 'As the horizon begins to get brighter, faint silhouettes begin to appear. The Buddhas are massive and the bell-shaped pagodas are even bigger. Almost twice as high as an average human, the pagodas are rough to touch and are neither embellished, nor engraved. Some of these are broken, a few are defaced, but they look sturdy and handsome. It is impossible to believe that the pagodas — or the Buddhas — are over 1,200 years old.', '“Isn’t it humbling to witness the enormity and intricacy of the temple? One can only imagine how hard this would have been to build at a time when there was no way to counter Nature. Wildlife, volcanoes, climate... everything was against them and yet they created such amazing things.” Paul, a co-traveller who has come all the way from Antwerp to witness the world’s largest Buddhist temple, wonders aloud even as we stand on the ground gaping at the monument in awe. The sun has risen behind us and the temple is gleaming in the golden light. Looking at the sprawling complex rising from the fluorescent earth like a large volcanic mountain, surrounded by mist and haze, I cannot but agree.', '', '', 'Borobudur is a wide complex built with black volcanic rocks', '', 'Hot spot', ""Java is the 13th largest island in the world and dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally.

Very large trees on either side of it cast their benevolent shadows in which we walk to the house. It stands in a clearing amid a mini forest.', 'The one-acre at Edavanakkad was painstakingly made into a forest by Manoj; he had to fend off attempts from his family who wanted to clear out the “jungle”, prune wild bushes and spruce up their living space. He often found himself at odds with people, who could not comprehend his philosophy of letting things be. Of not tending to the brambles and weeds, of doing a lot of things by doing nothing. He finally had his way, and the forest around grew and thrived. His mother has come around and at times even participates in plucking fruit and leaves that are edible.', 'An electrical engineer, Manoj was drawn to Nature and environmental conservation early on by virtue of his association with environmentalist professor John C Jacob. The concepts of natural living, nature cure and natural hygiene inspire him, but he does not claim to be an environmentalist or an activist.', '“I have always loved Nature without expecting anything from it.” His outlook towards life is hugely drawn from American writer Daniel Quinn’s ideology of not isolating man from Nature. “The two are not mutually exclusive. Man is a part of Nature, it is when we take ourselves out the equation that problems arise,” he says. Manoj is among the people who helped organise a weekly organic farmers’ market at Kakkanad where small-time farmers come together to sell their produce.', 'Fruit forests', 'Data recovery is his area of professional expertise, but his free time is devoted to encouraging organic farming and community farming initiatives in and around the Panchayat. ‘Fruitful Future’, a concept he is working on, aims at creating fruit forests. “It is not a romantic concept at all. Anyone who has a piece of unused land can cultivate one. It could be a random selection of fruit trees such as guava, passion fruit, papaya, chickoo, mango or jackfruit. A fruit forest can even be set up atop a terrace,” he says. The idea is to plant as many saplings in a limited space. “Even if they are planted close to each other, they would grow depending on the availability of sunlight.” For this, he draws from Japanese farmer-philospher Masanobu Fukuoka’s ‘do-nothing farming’ principle. “The only things we need to do to create a fruit forest is to prepare the land first. Clean it out and prepare it for mulching by layering the space with organic waste as much as possible. Then let it be as it is and reduce human interference. Very soon, earthworms and other micro organisms appear and the land is ready. Sow the seeds of fruits randomly. Slowly, they grow and over time, become giant trees bearing fruit.”', 'Permaculture, agro forestry and water harvesting are subjects he is in the process of learning, he says.', 'Manoj is particularly passionate about jackfruit, his own “forest” has easily over 200 jackfruit trees alone. He collects seeds and brings them home where he creates soil beds and sows the seeds. Once they grow into saplings, he gives them away to those who want to plant them. When he gets large orders, he charges a nominal fee per sapling. Manoj has helped create a fruit forest for a friend in Thrissur and he is in the process of talking to schools and colleges to encourage the idea of a fruit forest. He uses cloth grow-bags for the saplings in order to completely eliminate plastic. “The larger idea is to make people aware of community gardens, which a group of people can do together and benefit from,” he says.', 'He has not bought vegetables and fruits from shops for over three years now. Everything is available at home—from yam to pumpkin, banana and its blossoms, a multitude of spinach varieties, drumstick, chikoo, jackfruit, papaya, lemon, mangoes and coconuts to begin with. The tree variety is as diverse—\nnjaval, anjili, ilanji\n, palm, cinnamon, wild\nchembakam\n,\nsindoora varikka\n(red-fleshed jackfruit) and even young teak trees. In summer, Manoj survives on fruits that the trees give in plenty. “There is so much fruit, I give them away to friends.”', 'His land has two ponds and a small stream running through it, which swells and ebbs according to the tide. (Edavanakkad has the Vembanad lake on one side and the ocean on the other). Butterflies, bees, birds and creepy-crawlies are regular inhabitants, says Manoj, who adoringly cajoles a moth caterpillar (\nkambili puzhu)\ninto crossing over a twig towards its family.', 'Sacred groves', '', 'Manoj takes care of a scared grove a little away from his house, which belongs to his extended family. “Sacred groves have native trees and encourage biodiversity. Even today, houses with land can replicate a model of a sacred grove by planting trees native to the region.”', 'Manoj is not driven by an agenda, he speaks about things that he is passionate about unsentimentally. His forests and gardens are not manicured and what is considered aesthetically pretty. “I just want to make the land I live on fertile, so that other living beings can benefit from it, or not, I don’t know.

Kochi,"['Tirza Lavi is back to the land where she was born. Here with her husband and daughter, Tirza will visit her ancestral home town, North Paravur. Archaeologist and Founder-Curator of the Nevatim Museum in Israel that houses details, which preciously preserve her community’s enigmatic past, Tirza believes that the connection between Israel and India will never dim.', 'The Malabari Jews first set foot in India nearly 2,000 years ago. And the ancient seaport of Muziris, its neighbouring regions, was home to this community for generations, till Israel was formed in 1948. When the Jews left for the ‘Promised Land’ they took back with them memories of life here. Tirza is one such Jew.', '“I was born in Paravur as the seventh of nine children. We lived in a three-storied house built by my grandfather near the entrance to the town. Most of my community left before I was born. At that time, because of the dwindling numbers, members of the community in neighbouring Chendamangalam moved to Paravur. This was so because of the absence of a\nminyan\n(a quorum of 10 members needed for prayer at a synagogue) in their village,” says Tirza.', 'Later, Tirza too moved to Israel with her parents, at the age of 13. “It was like uprooting a tree and moving it to an unfamiliar surrounding. Everything was foreign, the language, culture, dress code and food.” In school, things were not easy, she says. She had to study Hebrew in depth and adapt to a completely new system. “I eventually succeeded in doing so, but what I realised was that an immigrant, especially one from India, stays different from the Israeli children.” Tirza explains that it took a while to let go off ‘the sense of home’, which was Kerala. And even years after living in Israel, she says that there is an uncanny tug at her heart to reach out to Paravur.', 'Memories of her childhood are vivid — of Hebrew and Malayalam lessons, festivities at the synagogue, and prayers. Much of their life revolved around the Synagogue and its grounds where children played, to the celebration of Israel’s independence day. “In Israel, the older generation strongly hold on to these memories and tradition.”', ""She, however, is concerned about the new generation who has little connection to their Indian ancestry, except through stories narrated to them by their families. Tirza is keen that this special history is preserved for posterity and works diligently for it. “It first began with my father's keen interest in our ancestry and then my MA study where I submitted two papers on the subject: One was on the immigration process of the Malabari Jews to Israel and the other was the absorption of the community and the second generation in Israel.” This sparked a keen love for the subject, and delving deeper into the details of it, she played a pivotal role in establishing a centre for Kerala Jews in Israel. “It began with an exhibition that was set up in 1984 to celebrate 30 years of immigration of the Jews from Kochi. The centre’s vision is to preserve and present the material and spiritual culture of the Jewish community of Kerala, and to serve as a cultural centre facilitating research.”"", 'The town of Paravur, where the community set foot 900 years ago (according to oral, local Jewish tradition), with its entrance columns, houses adorned with extensive backyards and wells, the grand Synagogue, and the echo of voices of the community elders in the town square, Tirza says remains today only in books and images at the small museum at the centre in Israel. The permanent exhibition reveals the atmosphere and life of the Jews in Kerala, before their migration, which includes rituals, weddings, celebration of Jewish holidays and so on. A film that narrates the customs and traditions of the Jews, including interviews with the elders of the community is also screened.', '“A special corner is dedicated to the holiday of Simchat Torah, the favourite festival of Cochinni Jews, that marks the end and start of the cycle of reading of the Torah.” The oil lamps and other artefacts offer knowledge of the tangible heritage of the community in Kerala. “Nearly 5,000 visitors visit the place annually,” says Tirza, and every year they have a get together for the members of the community, where they relive memories of their past.', 'Currently, Tirza is working on contributing to a book on Cochinni Jews. A collection of articles from various people of the community in Israel will be released shortly to add more information on the Malabari Jews in Israel. “We work to gather as much as information of the community as possible, memoirs, artefacts...everything that tells of our heritage.” Now, Tirza is looking forward to working on a project during the next Kochi-Muziris Biennale through a local collaboration.']"

Her take on Salim Kumar’s iconic dialogues have gone viral, shared/viewed many times over across various social media platforms.', '“He is my favourite actor, I am a huge fan of his, I love his work and there is so much potential with his dialogues!”', 'Going viral was the last thing she expected, some of her videos have been viewed a more than a lakh times. Her initial videos went viral when they were uploaded by social media companies and “changed my life as I knew it.”', 'A natural mimic, she unabashedly, sans self-consciousness, channelises the actor, his mannerisms et al.

He wanted me to create my own chances.” Her father, even in his absence, continues to be a guiding presence in her life she adds. Actor/dancer Thara Kalyan is her mother.', 'Explaining her work, she says she doesn’t use the Dubsmash app, instead converts videos to the MP3 format — selecting a scene and converting it to audio format on her phone. She then records her video. “I don’t show it to anybody before I upload a video. I upload it if I am convinced. I don’t have the patience to redo it, correct it.”', 'Her videos are spot on; the Salim Kumar impressions especially. An off day is typically spent making a few of these, “I learn the dialogues, which doesn’t take much time, set up the phone and I am on.

The attention that came her way was just a bonus, but she is pragmatic. Since her grandmother and mother are actors, are films the next stop? “I am not chasing films. In films there is a quest for a ‘new face’, for every film. I don’t want to be the ‘old’ face after one film, I am far too sensitive for that. There are no guarantees and instability makes me uncomfortable.”', 'The adulation her ‘dubsmash’ skills have got her aside this year has been tough on Sowbhagya, her father passed away suddenly earlier this year.

As we silently float over fields of yellow niger flowers, interspersed with navigating streams and green valleys, Atiqah Khairudin from Malaysia, the pilot of my hot air balloon, exclaims: “This is the most picturesque vista from the ultimate vantage point — the air!” The windy skies make me a bit nervous, but Atiqah assures me that it is going to be the most exciting experience of my life as I take my first balloon safari at the Araku Balloon Festival. Tucked away in the lap of Nature and serenity, Araku is known for its pristine valleys, cultural heritage, stunning waterfalls gushing out of the hills and coffee plantations.', 'Atiqah adds, “This beautiful piece of jewel is such a discovery for balloon pilots. It can be a great way to showcase its beauty to people who want to experience the grand panoramic view from the hot air balloon.” Ours was the first hot air balloon to take to the skies and one of the most compact ones. As we sail over the tribal hamlets and agricultural fields, all around us the sky fills with more hot air balloons looking like tiny dots of colourful confetti. At the festival, some of the world’s most experienced ballooning pilots have come to explore the virgin skies of Araku.', 'The winds have stabilised a bit, but the next challenge is to find a spot to land. Each balloonist has two radio sets — one for the pilot and the other for the staff below. While I find myself immersed in the magical scenes unfolding before me, Atiqah gets ready to land and sends a message from her radio set. “The most different way to fly a hot air balloon is to fly low and the most challenging part is to get a deal landing,” says the confident young pilot. By now, the winds have again picked up pace. Beneath us, there are just fields of yellow niger fields. As she prepares for the final part of the landing, I can sense a slight anxiety in her voice. “We are heading for a bit of an adventurous landing this time. Just hold on!” she instructs.', 'While I tightly fix myself to the corner of the basket, the balloon makes quite a strong impact on the field as we hit the ground. For a second, my heart is in my mouth. Within seconds, my anxiety meets the curious, excited faces of the villagers from the neighbouring tribal hamlet who run towards us to greet us with a warm hello. “This is the best part of ballooning. Wherever you land, you are always welcomed with such warmth,” remarks Atiqah, while we both get hold of the rope to pull the lovely yellow balloon to the ground.', '(Araku Balloon Festival is an initiative of AP Tourism in association with E-Factor and SkyWaltz)', '', 'Araku is known for its pristine valleys, cultural heritage and stunning waterfalls']"

Kochi,"['Notable effortAbove, Vellattanjur Sreejith, below, Abhiram Unni and the album coverSpecial Arrangement', 'One of the challenges of mixing and matching flavours with a firm Carnatic base is that it creates new sounds that are often fragile. What Vellattanjur Sreejith and Abhiram Unni have done in their album ‘Antara’ is to design a harmonic grid that encompasses the notes of a raga giving it a western spin. It is not just one grid but seven where multiple ragas emerge, where the various moods are explored keeping intact the character. It is not like the obscure fusion rather a confluence of musical styles.', 'Sreejith and Abhiram chose the ragas and krithis after much deliberation. “From the many that we short-listed them we chose those that Abhiram knew and those that he was confident of presenting well. Right from the time we embarked on this project we decided that we would attempt to give them a different musical treatment. Instead of the usual mridangam, ghatom or khanjira we thought of backing it with rich orchestration,” says Sreejith, a leading exponent of ghatom who has recorded, programmed, mixed and done the musical arrangement for ‘Antara’.', 'The traditional krithis and ragas are not really tampered with. Abhiram, a young vocalist who combines a passion for music with his banking career, has sung keeping the form pure and undiluted. “Sreejith asked me to sing them as I would do keeping the mood of the lyrics and the raga unscathed. He later wove my voice with the backing instruments to give it an amazing feel,” says Abhiram.', 'Brochevarevarura\n...(Khamas),\nManavyalakincha\n...(Nalinakanthi) and\nVande mataram\n...(Kuntalavarali) get a new treatment through ingenious orchestration. “For Khamas, which is predominantly melodious we added a brisk jathi that, we hope, has uplifted the piece. The use of guitar, saxophone, backing strings and a single violin helps give it a new colour. For Nalinakanthi we have tried out African tones and a rhythm pattern that is typically Western. Touches can be seen even in Kuntalavarali and Behag without disturbing the mood of the lyrics or that of the raga,” says Sreejith.', 'Irayimman Thampi’s\nAarodu cholvene\n... (Nathanamakriya) and Meenakshisuthan’s\nBalakrishnadevam\n...(Yamunakalyani) lend themselves to new manifestations. “Nothing has really changed except for the treatment of the notes and rhythms.\nBalakrishnadevam\n..., for instance, is given the colour of a bhajan with a constant rhythm pattern. And\nAarodu cholvene\n...is designed in the usual grid, like a typical padam. What we have tried is to enhance the major mood of the krithi using the veena instead of the usual violin,”says Abhiram.', 'A bunch of very talented musicians — Gokul Alankode (violin), Sajinlal Edappal (mridangam), AK Raghunath (flute), Anoop Vellattanjoor (guitar, edakka) and Biju Annamanada (veena )— have provided the backup, which incidentally is the soul of Antara.', 'Another interesting feature of this album is that the album has been recorded, mixed and mastered in the studio Sreejith set up at home. “I was always fascinated by this and tried to keep learning this art. I bought some minimum equipment and with the help of sound engineers set up this studio. Though I have done jingles, a couple of light songs, and the theme song for the Kerala School Kalolsavam in 2015 ‘Antara’ is the first full-fledged album from my studio,” says Sreejith.']"

New Delhi,"['And so, Chennai joins a select band of 64 metros across the world that have been labelled creative by UNESCO. We are recognised for our music. Yes, we are an extraordinarily musical city. The Carnatic music world is understandably jubilant. Which other city in the country has been conducting a music festival, no matter what its faults, for over 90 years and entirely funded by private initiative? The Margazhi festival began in 1927, with the Music Academy pioneering the December conference and concerts a year later. At least two great composers — Papanasam Sivan and Koteeswara Iyer were from here.', 'But then, Chennai’s music is not just Carnatic alone. The Sarva Deva Vilasa, a 19th century Sanskrit work on the city paints a picture of a thriving cultural metropolis with singers, dancers, pipers and drummers being active participants in processions, soirees and concerts. In Madras, it was customary for a man of status to be surrounded by musicians wherever he went in the city, noted the English. And they too joined in. Events of great importance to Madras, such as the granting of a charter for starting a Corporation (India’s oldest) in 1688, were occasions for much dancing and performing of country music. Devadasis and musicians accompanied the charter as it was taken around Fort St George. The English brought in Western classical music and we took to that too, ‘Carnaticising’ the violin and carrying on with the institutions they left behind such as the Madras Musical Association and Musee Musicals.', 'News dissemination', 'The lives of the common folk too appears to have been full of music. Memoirs of personalities such as Dr K.N. Kesari carry vivid descriptions of street performers, who excelled in music. A.R. Venkatachalapathy’s Songsters of the Crossroads deals with how in the early 20th century news was disseminated in Madras via chapbooks the contents of which were publicised by musicians singing them at street junctions. Songs on the Great Park Town Fire, the construction of the High Court, the Arubathu Moovar festival and the bombing of Madras by the Emden abound in these publications. For that matter, printing books on music began as early as 1859 in Madras and has continued ever since.', 'Theatre was an important source of music. The Parsi Theatre, chiefly the Balivala Troupe did a lot to popularise light classical North Indian tunes in Madras and these gradually entered Tamil theatre as Parsi varnamettus. Tamil theatre by itself was heavily musical with a whole lot of stars such as K.B. Sundarambal, M.K. Thyagaraja Bhagavatar, S.G. Kittappa and Golden Saradambal. The plays of Sankaradas Swamigal are embellished with wonderful songs.', 'Woman sound engineer', 'Tamil Cinema began talking (and singing) in 1931 and Madras became a production capital not long after. The first woman sound recording engineer, Meenakshi Narayanan, was from here. Much experimentation with various types of music went on in the studios of the city and Saluri Rajeswara Rao of Gemini is generally credited with introducing western tunes into south Indian cinema. The contributions of composers such as Viswanathan-Ramamurthy, Ilaiyaraja and A.R. Rahman are renowned the world over. It is also significant that till the 1980s, songs in all South Indian languages were recorded here, the films being made here as well.', 'The gramophone industry flourished here for long and Madras was a major production centre. Formal recording began here in 1905, making some singers such as Coimbatore Thayi internationally recognised. The non-classical variety — songs of daily life were also an important genre that sold well, as did film songs.', 'Chennai always had its own folk idiom. The fishermen were the first residents here and their music was commented on by the British. Then came the songs of the oarsmen who plied rafts from shore to Madras Roads, the spot in the sea where the ships berthed before we got a harbour. Today we have Gana Pattu, unique to our city, in Madras bhashai, the city’s own lingo.', 'This was where Ramalinga Swamigal sang of ‘Dharmamigu Chennai.’ Above all, who can forget Subramania Bharati, perhaps the most musical among Indian poets? He and others like him gave us freedom music as a genre too.', 'Now, is Chennai unique among Indian cities to merit this UNESCO tag? Maybe not. And will this tag make any difference? Probably not. We will carry on the way we are. The reaction in Chennai has been twofold — claiming credit for it being the first, completely denying any qualification for such a recognition being the second. Why not acknowledge a compliment and accept it gracefully? Indian cities rarely make it to the news for anything good, and when that happens, let us celebrate it.', '', 'Theatre was an important source of music.

I was overjoyed — Namma Chennai!', 'As M.S. Subbulakshmi once said, “Indian music is oriented solely towards divine communication. If I have done something in this respect, it is entirely due to the grace of the Almighty who has chosen my humble self as a tool.”', 'Tamil Nadu in general, and Chennai in particular, has been home to so many gems of Carnatic music — M.S Subbulakshmi, my guru M.L Vasanthakumari, D.K Pattammal, T.

Their contributions have made the city what it is today. Global recognition was long overdue.', 'New audiences', 'My relationship with Carnatic music began 37 years ago. Since then, I have worked relentlessly to keep our tradition alive and thriving, along with many other musicians. Over the years, I have seen our music expand to many corners of the world, reaching newer audiences while always remaining rooted to its home, Chennai.', 'It is quite amazing to think that the Margazhi festival or the ‘December Music Season’ as it is fondly referred to, first started in 1927. Aside from the musicians, the sabhas have played a pivotal role in ensuring that the spirit of Margazhi is captured in all its glory with each passing year.', 'The first on the list is the Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha, which began as early as 1896, by Mani Tirumalachariar. Launched as the Sangeetha Vidwat Sabha in 1900, it was rechristened as Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha.', 'Another great example is the Madras Music Academy, which had its humble beginnings staging performances under a pandal. Today, it has grown exponentially into one of India’s premier institutions for the performing arts.', 'Let us not forget Tamil Isai Sangam, another pioneering institution that was born out of the efforts of Raja Sir Annamalai Chettiar, who sought to revive interest in the forgotten works of Tamil poets, in 1953. Subsequently, other sabhas came into being.', 'It was not only Carnatic music that drew big crowds; Harikatha and Bhakti Sangeetham played a huge role in attracting large audiences. Classical music made its way into the film industry as well. Bharatanatyam queens such as T. Balasaraswati, the Travancore sisters, Kumari Kamala, and Vyjayanthimala Bali were outstanding performers.', '', 'Each year, the Margazhi season evolves, becoming bigger and better — growing in number and size of events, with new and talented performing artistes and the many cafeterias serving delicious snacks. A staggering amount of labour and coordination goes into making this event a success.', 'Recognition deserved', 'During this time, our beloved city brings so many people together — musicians, teachers, musicologists, natya exponents, students, technicians, and event organisers. I’m thrilled that we are finally receiving the global recognition that an annual event like Margazhi deserves.', 'An Advisory Body on Intangible Cultural Heritage & Diverse Cultural Traditions of India (ABICHU), was created by the Ministry of Culture to facilitate application for this recognition. As a member of this Advisory Body, I can attest to the dedication and focus of this group’s work towards achieving this status.', 'However, while we celebrate this achievement, we must also set our sights on the future. It is time to invest in institutions that will preserve the legacy of Carnatic music — such as a museum, which will amplify the history of Carnatic music with past legends’ memorabilia, and a world-class school exclusively for music and other arts.', 'To fully embody the spirit of this honour, Chennaiites must continue to support and encourage the development and education of the next generation of artistes and rasikas that will carry Carnatic music to newer heights — our music can only live on through them.', 'Jai Hind!', '', 'As a member of the Advisory Body, I can attest to the dedication and focus of the group’s work towards achieving this status!', '', 'Aside from the musicians, the ‘sabhas’ have played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Marghazhi Season continues in full glory']"
New Delhi,"['Incessant rains had forced the Santhal members of the Birbhum Blossom Theatre to leave their usual performance site in Dwaronda village. The clay stage that they had built, with palm frond wings and backdrop, soaked in the showers, just like their huts and would have to be painstakingly repaired later on.', 'But for the moment the team concentrated only on the show. Even the stage at Srijani in Sriniketan, rather inadequate and disagreeable, couldn’t curb their enthusiasm. Artistes of our country are largely agreeable. And once the performance began, even the audience (many of them academics and urban theatre buffs) forgot to complain about the mosquito-infested flat viewing area and dirty plastic chairs.', 'The play began with the lights rolling off a vertical structure, perhaps representing a daunting tree or cliff face. At the very top was a bunch of flaming red flowers. On the ground armed guards kept vigil. The lights increased as a youngster in white descended the structure with the flowers in his hand. His smiling visage made us momentarily forget the guards lurking in the shadows thus increasing the impact of their brutal attack. The unrelenting oppressive darkness of Yakshapuri took over.', ""Expectations ran high as this unique Santhali adaptation of Tagore's ‘Raktakarabi’ unfolded. The sight of raktakarabi or red oleander blossoms crushed by metal junk in Shillong 1924 had inspired Tagore to write this play that conjures up a vision of an arid mechanised world where man’s greed and power loots the earth of gold yet man is himself reduced to a slave with a number instead of a name."", 'Symbolism of red colour', 'In 2017, director Partha Gupta, has given up the exotic feel of raktakarabis to use the title ‘Ara Baha,’ which just means any red flower. The emphasis is on the red colour with all its associations of life giving blood, of love, spontaneous passion, even revolt. The title also calls to mind the tenderness, beauty and fragility of live petals.', 'Partha (38) is from Birbhum and has lived close to the Santhal villages for many years imbibing their culture, their music, dance and rituals some of which he has incorporated in a book. He studied drama at Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata, and spent time observing master theatre director Ratan Thiyam working with his group Chorus Repertory Theatre in Manipur.', ""All this prepared him to work with a tribal community that knew nothing of theatre or Tagore. Apart from the difficulty of translating Tagore’s lines and communicating the complexities to the villagers of Dwaronda, Partha felt it was text-heavy. “So much dialogue is no longer needed to communicate Tagore's work,” he says. So he did away with most of the dialogue and used choreography, physical acting and visual motifs to communicate the essence of the play. Interestingly, the play has survived."", 'The few lines of Santhali dialogue, their music and dance expressed the angst of the soul. The fact that this was happening close to Tagore’s Visva Bharati seemed significant. If the Bohurupee’s faithful production of Tagore’s text directed by Sambhu Mitra was a landmark, this presentation by the marginalised Santhals, who worked in the fields and were largely illiterate, seemed closer to the bard’s dream of his songs uniting with life.', 'With texts widely read like Shakespeare and Tagore, the presentation can afford to be suggestive. So it is not difficult to identify the Yakshapuri with its terrible Raja who remains hidden to keep up his image of omnipotence and Nandini decked in red flowers that symbolise her love for Ranjan and the promise of life and joy.', 'The first scene of ‘Ara Baha’ easily substitutes the long interaction in which Nandini worries that Kishore will get into trouble for skipping work at the mines to go looking for the raktakarabi and Kishore says that for her, he would happily lay down his life.', 'To Partha the play was the bard’s expression of personal crisis, a terrible internal tussle, not some international political statement. Raja and Ranjan are parallel identities Nandini loves them both and Nandini is empathetic to a number of lesser characters who like reverberations of both Ranjan and Raja, are charmed by her.', 'Ranjan, never shown on stage by Tagore, makes a brief appearance here as a young man playing the banam, a traditional Santhal string instrument. When later Nandini appears cradling the banam like Ranjan’s corpse, or a child, the message that a musical instrument can begin to play again at any moment is beautifully suggested.', ""In the Santhali rendition, Nandini is seen transforming or rather opening out like a butterfly from a chrysalis. The leaf woven Pekhe (used by rural women to shelter from rain while working in the fields) is used here as the covering that Nandini takes off. The teacher muses over the shed Pekhe as if to understand and analyse Nandini better. A traditional mask dance Banshai is used to convey the sense of threat and traditional Santhali songs are used instead of Rabindra Sangeet. “I don't compose anything, I apply,” said Partha."", 'Not all his efforts work, however. There is confusion in parts and some introductions like the Professor wearing gloves because he can’t touch Nandini and the red dais to the triumph of life over death and violence seem a little out of place.', 'Durga Baski (Nandini), and Suriya Hembrem (Kishore), are in class XII of a local school. They have been doing theatre since 2013 and show no signs of backing out. While the men play truant at times, the women, who dominate in the community, are regular at rehearsals and are professional in their outlook. Partha pays them on a daily basis and arranges for snacks. One waits for the day when his efforts will prompt the Santhals to tell their own stories on stage.', '', 'To Partha the play was the bard’s expression of personal crisis, a terrible internal tussle, not some international political statement']"

She was one who renounced her motherland, and all the mores that she was accustomed to, for the cause of India. Her greatness manifested in myriad dimensions. Her dedication, her spirituality and her renunciation are well-discussed.', 'However, it is her multifaceted character and intense love for India that springs to life through this compilation of some 886 letters, which have been published recently by Advaita Ashrama, the publication wing of the Ramakrishna Math. The letters also hold a mirror to the India of those times through the eyes of Nivedita.', 'The present Advaita Ashrama edition — with 85 newly discovered letters — is published nearly 35 years after the first publication of her letters in two volumes, thanks to Prof. Sankari Prasad Basu, a renowned scholar and researcher of Vivekananda. The letters are written to eminent people within India and abroad, between 1897 and 1911.', 'Nivedita wrote the letters almost like a diary to her family, friends and acquaintances across the globe. The recipients include eminent thinkers, philosophers, Nobel laureates, newspaper editors, poets (like Rabindranath Tagore) and scientists. The common thread is her overwhelming love for the land that she adopted as her own. They reveal for the first time some unknown incidents during the British Raj, like a private visit to Nivedita by Lady Minto, then the vicerine, who also went to Dakshineswar temple. Letters were also written to poets, thespians, to famous designer Lalique, to William John Warner (better known as Cheiro).', 'The maximum number of letters were written to Josephine Mcleod and Mrs Ole Bull, American friends of Swami Vivekananda, who helped and supported Sister Nivedita right from her arrival in India.', 'Margaret Noble was only 10 when she lost her father. But within those tender years she must have imbibed a lot of the values that her clergyman father had held. These acted as her lode star, as she left her home and her country in 1898, following in the footsteps of Swami Vivekananda.', 'She and her siblings were brought up by her grandfather Hamilton, one of the pioneers of the Irish Freedom struggle. That also left some influence on her, as we can gauge from her increasing involvement in India’s freedom struggle, which led to her severance of her ties with the Ramakrishna Math and Mission after Swami Vivekananda’s passing away.', 'Education for girls', 'Teaching was close to Nivedita’s heart and she broke new ground in this respect, before she set sail. It is said that what attracted Nivedita to Vivekananda (who held sessions in London in 1895-96 ) was not only his talk on Vedanta but also his talk on girls’ education in India. She was moved enough to leave her home for India to serve the girl children there.', 'Her admiration for Vivekananda led to an all-embracing love for India which was then under the British rule. The whites here were dismissive of her, the erudite Indians accepted her but she had to face the rigidities of the orthodox Hindu society. However, in her letter to Sara Bull, she writes how Sarada Devi, the wife of Ramakrishna Paramhamsa, would accept her — calling her\namar meye\n(my daughter) — and even sharing food with her, Mrs. Bull and Miss Macleod.', '“This gave us all the dignity and made my future work possible in a way nothing else possibly could have done,” she later wrote in a letter.', 'Her Irish background saw her steadily getting drawn into the burgeoning freedom movement even as her love for the country and its peoples began to manifest through her letters.', 'If one goes through\nThe Statesman\nbetween 1904 and 1906, which were watershed years in the Swadeshi Movement, the paper’s sympathetic stance towards India and its nationalistic struggle is revealed. There was an unknown force at work here — the letters written by Sister Nivedita to Samuel Ratcliffe, the editor of the paper. For some time, she herself edited a nationalist paper after Aurobindo Ghosh left for Pondicherry.', 'Nivedita declared in a letter to Ms Macleod: “The British Empire is rotten to the core, without direction, and is tyrannical and mean...”', 'She also guided and mentored the Neo India art movement of her times especially what later came to be known as the Bengal school whose exponents include Abananindranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose and Asit Kumar Haldar.', 'Nivedita, who spent 13 years in India till her death, opened a school in 1898 by going from door to door, pleading with parents to send their girls to her school. She joined Swami Vivekananda, when he tended to the plague stricken people in erstwhile Calcutta.', 'Interest in Nivedita’s inner thoughts was first kindled through the Bengali translation of her biography (in French by Lizelle Remond around 1960); the actual discovery of a large cache of letters written by Nivedita set the stage for the publication of these volumes.', 'The letters were in the custody of Srimat Anirvan, a Vedic pundit and yogi.', 'On a Sunday afternoon, in a house in South Kolkata, the treasure trove was handed over to Prof. Basu with only one condition: that he would use them to work on Nivedita.

From caste and communal divide to the policy of divide and rule pursued by rulers, everything has been addressed by Sahir Ludhianvi in simple, hummable verse. So this Children’s Day, I decided to search for more and in the process rediscovered an old tape of classic children songs that had educated me more about life than my classroom texts ever did. Long back, I had strung these pious songs together as they were noble assertions of ideals that had shaped beliefs and identities of me and my siblings as secular citizens. Inspired by Nehruvian principles of social welfare, what touched me was that these lovely songs, despite reflecting personal concerns, upheld sublime truths of humanism.', 'Hindi films have given umpteen songs for children that have stood the test of time in terms of melody and magnificence of thought. One is awestruck by the diverse topics covered by our old time lyric writers within the small span of a three minute song that deal primarily with children’s antics. From the cradle to the lap of a parent or from an ice cream to a railway journey, our lyricists drew insights that were simple in verse, vividly colourful in imagery yet distilled with lofty ideas to inspire and impact a young mind.', 'If Pandit Nehru has been a favourite ‘chacha’ (paternal uncle), the moon has been everyone’s eternal ‘mama’ (maternal uncle) to give rise to innocent tales like “Chanda Mama Door Ke” (“Vachan”) and “Chanda Mama Mere Dvaar Aana” (“Lajwanti”). Putting children to sleep with a lullaby is centuries old habit and old film ‘lories’ have been supremely endearing. Who can forget Geeta Dutt’s “Nanhi Paree Sone Chali” (“Sujaata”), Lata’s “Aa Jaree Aa Nindiya Tu Aa” (“Do Bigha Zamin”) and “Tim Tim Karte Tare” (“Chiraag Kahan Roshni Kahan”) which are as cherished as Rafi Sahab’s soulful “Main Gaaon Tum So Jaao” (“Brahmachari”).', 'Drawing from filial interactions, Sahir, Hasrat, Shailendra, Prem Dhawan, Pradeep, Majrooh and Shakeel created ‘poetical recipes’ that bring joy and smile to this day.

The best of present day gurus cannot match the wholesome wisdom bestowed by “Nanhe Munne Bachche” (“Boot Polish”) or “Zindagi Hai Kya Sun Meri Jaan” (“Maya”)… perfect examples of the poetical greatness of our film lyricists to cull life philosophies into six crisp lines. Listen to the latter song and you’d wonder as to who has the sagacity in this era to put forth the purpose of human life in an ice cream vendor’s sales pitch like this Rafi-Majrooh-Salil Chowdhary melody does in moments?', 'If “Nanha Munna Raahi Hun” (“Son of India”), “Chalo Chale Maa” (“Jagriti”), “Aam Chhum Taam Chhum” (“Chhote Nawab”) or “Papaa Jaldi Aa Jana” (“Taqdeer”) astound us with the maturity of the children, there are several ‘adult child’ songs that make us teary-eyed to this day remembering our beloved elders. Compassionate, homely pleas of “Tu Hoke Bada Ban Jaana” (“Khandaan”), “Ilaahi Tu Sun Le Hamaree Dua” (“Chhote Nawab”) and “Tere Bachpan Ko Jawani Ki Dua Deti Hun” (“Mujhe Jeene Do”) make us yearn once again for those invaluable moments of togetherness that we spent in the arms of our parents. Hope this Children’s day, we listen to Kaifi Azmi’s “Meri Awaaz Suno” (“Naunihaal”), an immortal tribute to Pandit Nehru, and realise loving like children alone can keep this nation together.']"

She is sweet bubbly Bombay girl who loves to remain happy and is very warm to people around her. There was a lot of me in it than the character itself and that is why Akshat was very happy. He knew that I can relate with the character very easily. Akshat is very warm and allows actors to explore themselves without directing them how to express. He just hints on what he requires from us and rest he gives space to his actors.', 'How was the experience working with Saif Ali Khan?', 'It is a crazy movie and everybody has put some sort of their own craziness in the film. I am sharing screen space with Saif and Akshay Oberoi both though most of my scenes are with Akshay. I remember when the first time he came on the set, he was in a unique getup which people would have seen in the posters in which he is posing in a fur coat. The way he carries himself in that offbeat role is commendable. Not only me but the whole cast and crew were amazed by the way he pulled off the scenes in that getup. You really respect the actor who likes to experiment with the form and I am glad that I worked with him.', 'The film is facing problems with Central Board of Film Certification also…', 'I think it is really silly. We as a country is full of people and we are such a big audience. I do not think anyone should have any right to ban or even ask for a cut in the movie. A scene in the film is there for a reason and it takes away the meaning if it is not there in the film. The Board should just certify the film so that the viewers who want to watch the film can know about its content.', 'You are one of those actors who are transcending boundaries of language in cinema…', 'The beauty of Indian cinema is its difference from region to region, be in terms of aesthetics or the grammar. While working in different regions, an actor learns a lot about different cultures, different sets of people working on the set and their sensibilities, it all is a fodder for an actor. Sometimes in southern industry, characters are louder as people demand it and you can see that in dance, choreography, actions, and dialogues. People like that and that is why we do it. That in a way really helps the actors to minimise their inhibitions and come out of their comfort zones.', 'After working in a number of films at a young age, what is your present state of mind?', 'I still feel like a newcomer. Every set is so different and I believe it is for good reasons as new people keep meeting me. Being an actor was my dream ever since I was a child and I am living it. From my early days in modelling to every new commitment, is like a first job for me every time. I have no plans and I am a person who goes with the flow. The only thing that drives me is those different sort of roles which allow me to experiment. You will not find me repeating a character or carrying similar mannerism in different films. I get bored easily and if there is no fun. I am a rebellious North Indian girl and I was not sure if I would have said yes to a film like “Rajma Chawal” if it would not be from South as it allows me to challenge myself.']"

Nayan Ghosh', 'The recently held Bhavan Sangeet Samaroh presented some of the best artistes in Hindustani and Carnatic music.', 'The three-day festival opened with a rousing concert of saraswathi veena by Dr. Jayanthi Kumaresh. The niece of the late violin maestro Lalgudi Jayaraman, Jayanthi comes from the sixth generation of a renowned lineage of musicians. Initiated into veena by her mother Lalgudi Rajalakshmi, she did gurukulavasam with Padmavathy Ananthagopalan for intense training in this musical instrument. Jayanthi was further groomed under veena maestro Sundaram Balachander.', 'Opening with “Vathapi Ganapathim Bhajeham…”, the famous Hamsadhwani composition of Muthuswami Dikshitar, and “Parvati-kumaram bhaje….” by the same composer, she presented raga Nattakurinji set to Rupaka talam. After finishing it with a gopuchha tihai, she proceeded towards the main ‘Ragam-Thanam-Pallavi’ in raga Kamavardhini or Pantuvarali, a complete evening raga equal to Hindustani Puriya-Dhanashri and gave it a thorough treatment. The pallavi was set to Misra-Triputa Talam, similar to Hindustani Rupak. Jayanthi took time to tune her instrument to pitch-perfect tunefulness before opening her main piece. The captivating ‘Krishna-Arjun Samvad’ during the Thani Avarthanam between mridangam of Arjun Kumar and ghatam by Trichy Krishna invited repeated applause. Jayanthi concluded her vibrant veena recital with a lilting folk tune in Bihag.', 'Bombay Jayashri reached the inaugural evening to its sublime climax with a riveting ‘Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi’ in Carnatic Thodi ragam sung leisurely with controlled pacing and rich phrasings. The meditative rendering mirrored her calm disposition and strong conviction about her art. Being trained in Hindustani music also, she must be absolutely aware of the mental conditioning of music lovers of North India, who would feel uncomfortable with Carnatic Thodi. The fact that in Hindustani classical music the shuddha and vikrit shades of the same swara are never put adjacent to each other, hence the consecutive rishabh of Carnatic Thodi put together would sound sort of dissonant to the ears habitual to Hindustani music, never bothered her.', 'Risk taker', 'No doubt, she took a calculated risk, but ultimately left a profound impact on her listeners exploiting all the nuances of the raga during an hour long rendition of a soulful ragam, swiftly designed tanam and a pulsating pallavi. Mysore Srikanth, Manoj Siva, B.S. Purushottam and Amrit Ramnath provided her commendable support.', 'The forceful throw of the full throated voice of Pt. Vinayak Torvi brought back the memory of his legendary Guru Pt. Bhimsen Joshi. The traditional bada khayal “Aal so bana..” set to slow Ektala in raga Puriya-Dhanashri saw the simultaneous ‘Bharav’ in the tabla sangat of Pt. Ashish Sengupta. Assisted with the vocal support of his well-groomed disciple Siddhartha Belmannu and on harmonium by Sham Kumar Bharati, Torvi went on to sing the chhota khayal “Bahut din bite….” in Teentala and a Tarana in Drut Ektala that awed the audience with his taiyyar taans. This was followed by Kalawati announced as bhajan but sounded more like a khayal in addha theka, before he concluded with Bhairavi.', 'The Samaroh reached its climax with the sonorous sitar recital by Pt. Nayan Ghosh along with the brilliant tabla accompaniment by his gifted son and disciple Ishaan Ghosh. Pt. Nayan Ghosh holds a unique position as an artiste being a front ranking tabla and sitar maestro, equally sought after in both the streams. He received in-depth training in vocal, tabla and sitar under his renowned father Pt. Nikhil Ghosh. Ishaan also seemed the chip of the old block in his impressive and impromptu upaj as repartees to Nayan’s sizzling sitar.', 'Nayan’s sitar, first of all, grabs all your attention with its ringing tonal quality. His sitar was so exquisitely tuned that the sound itself was enough. And his sharp ears kept watch all through his arresting recital. He opened with a detailed Alap-Jod-Jhala in raga Shuddha Kalyana followed with a Vilambit Masitkhani and a Drut Gat composition in Teen-tala. Being a raga for vocalised idiom, Shuddha-Kalyan is a challenging raga to deal with on sitar. But Nayan showed full grasp over the essence of the raga, with utmost restraint. His relaxed and easygoing style kept the audience regaled. The mukhda or the opening phrase of the Drut Gat with a swift Taan was followed exactly by Ishaan’s tabla, that had a ready response to each and every intricacy of the sitar.', 'The main raga was followed by a contrasting Kamod. Nayan sonorously sang and played the melodious “koyaliya kook sunaye….” as his concluding treat. One would have imagined the graceful virtuosity of Pt. Nayan Ghosh but Ishaan’s tabla came as a pleasant surprise. The gifted boy showed exceptional promise.', 'This year, Bhavan Shikhar Samman was awarded to Vidwan T.V.

New Delhi,"['In synchronisationA scene from ‘Natya Rasanubhuti’', 'When a master mind touches upon a subject, it emerges as a compliment to his creative genius. So it was with ‘Natya Rasanubhuti’, a thematic ballet which did not have a story to go by, yet breathed life and contour into an abstract artistic response called ‘rasa’. The classical structure of Kuchipudi intact, the signature ahaarya (costume), stately Sanskrit verses interlaced with a few regional (Telugu) lyrics lent a profound character to the theme which stayed so from start to finish without flagging an inch. The brilliant orchestra further enhanced the effect.', 'The leitmotif follows a gradual development: firstly elucidating and exploring Bharatiya natyam (dance) with guru as the pivot. The eight dancers on stage move in tandem to song and mnemonics falling into formations with utmost precision. Guru Raja Reddy’s forte is absolute adherence to taal which is so visible in each and every dancer who was on stage that it was sheer pleasure to watch the show. He appears on the pedestal against the backdrop as guru to the chant of the Gayatri (longer version) mantra and the essential principle of dance, viz. ‘yatho hasta tatho drishti...’ which gets expanded through mime, giving the impression of the importance of guru in the learning of this art. Then the dance moves on to the nine artistic moods imbibed in expression of dance-the navarasa each of which was elucidated by duo or single dancer with ample imagery to make the intangible into tangible.', 'The pair Pernia Qureshi and Ananya Khosla took up the Shringara (erotic/romance) rasa subtly striking amorous postures as the song went by giving room to the next rasa-an antithesis to love – veeram (valour). Mahesh with his brisk and energetic footwork was a fit artiste to the mood. Bhavana Reddy’s histrionics is commendable as she takes up the hasya (mirth) and bhayanaka (fear).', 'Of skills and agility', '', 'The first few minutes footwork display to pure percussion before launching into expressive fear stood testimonial to her skills and agility. The tanam tones for karunya (pathos) rasa was melodic and the black and gold costume worn by the artistes as they danced vivaciously and then suddenly fell to the ground to denote sudden onslaught of death and accompanying pathos was a little too dramatic. Yamini Reddy chips towards the end miming the grief that takes its toll after life is snuffed out. The bheebatsa (gory) where Yamini took the story of Bheem killing Dushasan and devouring his entrails was a very striking instance of this rasa ably played out by the artiste. A mythological duel artfully executed by Sloka and Rashmi Vaidyalingam sufficed to convey roudra (fury) rasa. The gurus Radha and Raja Reddy took the stage to emote shanta (peace) and adbhuta (wonder) rasa respectfully. It is creditable that Radha Reddy moved across the stage to song with agility and the inner joy of dance was visibly evident in her body kinetics and her expressive countenance. Raja Reddy’s stances and abhinaya cheered the audience.', 'Grand conclusion', '', 'The concluding group convergence to Shanti mantra was an apt finale. Lavanya Sundaram and Deevi Ravikanth on the vocal enhanced the show with their sonorous voice as was a compelling Bhaskar Rao on the mridangam. Ananta Krishna made his presence felt with the flute which was mesmerising at times. Raghavendra on violin, Satish on edakka, Kamal Ahmed on sarangi made for a wholesome orchestra while the commanding tones of Kaushalya Reddy vested the nattuvangam with potency. Kamani Auditorium played host to the 10 year celebrations of Hyderabad branch of Natya Tarangini.']"

Either everyone was equally at fault, or this was the way different people coped with trauma.

They may like to dress up differently, but their identity remains linked to the family. I am glad that Hindustani classical music still values the gharana traditions to a great extent. This inspired me to rekindle the lost sense of pride among the musicians. This is the first ever soiree of this kind in recent times,” emphasises Ganguly.', 'Only time will tell if this herculean effort to stunt the onslaught of deviations for the sake of preserving pedigree-purity would work in a positive way! Historically, the process of carving unique singing styles had started when the Moghul era was at its decline and it had started to unsettle the culturally conscious intelligentsia. To protect their art along with their life Hindu musicians had started embracing Islam. When Aurangzeb made it amply clear that music was not welcome in his fanatically rigid Islamic reign, even Muslim musicians preferred to leave the capital and look for small states or towns for protection. Some migrated to the coastal regions like Bengal or down south; but most shifted base to smaller places in central or northern India and lived contentedly huddled in closely-knit gharanas.', 'Linguistically, gharana being an Indo-Persian word indicates that this came into existence during the Moghul period and clung on to Khayal, the greatest fusion that ever happened in Indian classical music which branched out as one of its two distinctly different streams. In the realm of Hindustani classical music, while banis are associated with Dhrupad, gharanas got associated with khayal singing around early 19th Century.', '“In those far off primeval days,” the word gharana would make a world of difference to its descendants and followers because even a small village would seem like the universe to its inhabitants. As an old tradition, the gharana system of music was very strict and, apparently, each gharana was\n\nnamed after a specific city/village where the master lived and students studied. The absence of mass transportation and communication ensured the survival of these strict practices along with secrecy related to their uniqueness.', 'Delhi’s loss, Lucknow’s gain', '', 'Then, the course of events overturned during the reign of Mohammad Shah ‘Rangeela’, the last Moghul emperor of Delhi (1719 – 1748) when music and musicians enjoyed the undivided attention of the ruler. But soon enough Nadir Shah struck a severe blow. Delhi fell and its loss became Lucknow’s gain when Nawab Asafuddaula (1775 -1797) came to power. This was the time when Miyan Ghulam Rasool ventured to blend qawwali with dhrupad. His son-in-law Shakkar Khan and his bother Makkhan Khan (better known as qawwal-bacche) polished this new foem. Ghulam Rasool’s son Ghulam Nabi (the famed Shori Miyan) went to Punjab, learnt tappa and shared it with his relatives.', 'That is how this ‘Lucknowi’ melodic form was born. Later they shifted to Gwalior, the seat of Dhrupad. Soon their music gained ground and thus all khayal gharanas namely Gwalior, Agra, Delhi Rampur, Kirana, Jaipur, Patiala etc. owe their origin to Ghulam Rasool and his descendants; albeit, today, no one remembers Lucknow.', '‘I do!’ exclaims Ganguly, ‘especially because the legendary Begham Akhtar, one of my Gurus, exposed me to this gharana’s subtle nuances; and that is why I am presenting Kolkata-based Anirban-Diptam a young vocalist duo trained by Vidushi Mandira Lahiri (disciple of the legendary Chinmay Lahiri).’ Lahiri explains, “The most striking feature is our voice-throw that needs extremely sensitive modulation according to the demand of the lyrics – be it a khayal bandish, thumri-dadra or ghazal singing; because Lucknow boasts of its exemplary tehzeeb (etiquette) and nafaasat (finesse). Despite the difference in these forms’ treatment, the emotive content of the melody-dipped literature reigns supreme.”', 'Apart from these participants belonging to this oldest school of vocalism, the three-day fest will see Bhuvanesh Komkali, a torch bearer of a new gharana, Devas; and also of other eminent vocal gharanas along with Amaan Ali Khan, the sole instrumentalist belonging to Bangash gharana. “Everyone, including the listeners, are requested to come dressed up in yellow, the auspicious colour of friendship.

New Delhi,"['How should literature, painting, film or other arts be understood and interpreted?', 'One is not sure as to what kind of artistic liberties director Sanjay Leela Bhansali has taken while making “Padmavati”, but one can say with absolute certainty that Padmavati is not a historical person. She is the central character of Malik Muhammad Jayasi’s Awadhi epic ‘Padmavat’, hails from Simhala Dweep (Sri Lanka), marries Chittor’s ruler Ratan Sen who has to face many hardships to win her over, and is a motif for divine beauty. Jayasi was a Sufi poet who had settled in village Jayas (now in Rae Bareilly district of Uttar Pradesh) as this region at that time was witnessing great activity of the Sufis of the Chishti silsila. ‘Padmavat’ is held in high regard as a love poem in the tradition of Sufi mysticism and Ratan Sen is supposed to be the symbol of soul that strives to unite with the divine, cosmic lover Padmavati. They are not historical characters although Jayasi has introduced a few historical characters like Sultan Allauddin Khilji as a villain. It is true that Khilji attacked Chittor and defeated its Rajput ruler but contemporary historical records do not mention either Ratan Sen or Padmavati. Padmavati is also referred to as Padmini in conformity with the traditional Indian classification of women into four categories – Padmini, Chitrani, Shankhini and Hastini –Padmini being the most beautiful, the most virtuous and the most ideal.', 'Representing beauty', '', 'As Padmavati represents the divine beauty, she is a Padmini and whosoever sees her comes under her divine spell.', 'Jayasi began to compose his mystical love epic in 1521 CE and finished it sometime circa 1540 CE. Although ‘Padmavat’ is part of the Hindi syllabus for under-graduate and post-graduate classes, it is hardly ever mentioned that Jayasi wrote it in Persian script and its various subsequent manuscripts were found in Arabic and Kaithi scripts too. When Tulsidas began to write his ‘Ramcharitmanas’, he took ‘Padmavat’ as a model and followed the same Doha-Chaupai structure that it employed. The only difference was in the language. While Jayasi’s Awadhi had the full flavour of the spoken dialect, Tulsidas crafted his own poetic language by making a most judicious and creative use of Sanskrit words and coalesced them so well with Awadhi that they did not stand out at all.', 'Ramchandra Shukla, a titan in the field of Hindi literary criticism and historiography, prepared a critical edition of ‘Padmavat’ that was brought out by Kashi Nagari Pracharini Sabha in 1924. In 1952, well-known Hindi scholar Mata Prasad Gupta prepared another critical edition that was published by Hindustani Academy, Prayag. Around the same time, top Hindi poet Maithili Sharan Gupta persuaded eminent art historian, archaeologist and cultural commentator Vasudev Sharan Agrawala to prepare a new critical edition. Titled ‘Padmavat: Malik Muhammad Jayasi krit Mahakavya (Mool aur Sanjeevani Vyakhya)’ [Padmavat: An epic written by Malik Muhammad Jayasi (Original and Sanjeevani Commentary)], it was published in 1955 and distributed by Lokbharti Prakashan on behalf of Gupta’s small publishing venture Sahitya Sadan, Jhansi. It happens to be the best critical edition as well as commentary till date.', 'Naming poems', '', 'As great Hindi scholar Hazari Prasad Dwivedi has noted, there was a long tradition of such love poems that were based on folk tales. Most of them were named after their heroines such as ‘Ratnavali’, ‘Padmavati’, ‘Vasavadatta’ and ‘Kuvalaymala’. In the ninth century CE, Kautuhal wrote a long love poem ‘Leelavati’ in Prakrit while Mayur penned a poetic work ‘Padmavati-katha’ in the tenth century CE. In ‘Prithviraj Raso’, we come across stories of Prithviraj’s marriage with Padmavati, Hansavati and Indravati etc. In Dwivedi’s view, the story of Padmavati had already been in circulation for many centuries when Jayasi decided to pick it up for his epic poem ‘Padmavat’. He came in the line of Sufi poets like Maulana Daud who had composed a similar love poem ‘Chandayan’ between 1371 CE and 1379 CE in the town of Dalmau near Rae Bareilly. Its heroine Chanda too belongs to the most beautiful and accomplished category of the Padmini women.', 'In ‘Padmavat’, Brahmin Raghav Chetan and Kshatriya Devapal, ruler of Chittor’s neighbouring kingdom Kumbhalmer, come through as much villainous as Allauddin Khilji. In Ratan Sen’s absence, Devapal offers to marry Padmavati and puts enormous coercive pressure on her, leading to a war between him and Ratan Sen. Sufi poets like Jayasi were familiar with the\ntopoi\n(literary themes and formulas) of the earlier poetic works of Prakrit and Apabhransha and they made creative use of them to illumine the mystical content of their epic poems. The character of Padmavati should be viewed in the light of its literary significance and must not be confused with any historical person.']"

But Persephone, because she has eaten a few pomegranate seeds when in the underworld, is forced to spend part of the year in the underworld, below ground — the months of winter, when nothing grows again, as Demeter grieves the absence of her daughter.', 'Leads to rage', '', 'In our mythology, one of the most descriptive myths of loss, describing how grief can give way to fury and destruction, is the story of Shiva and Sati, where Sati, disturbed by how her husband has been ignored by her father, jumps into a sacrificial fire and dies. Shiva’s grief leads to rage. Holding Sati’s body, in a frenzy of grief, He begins the tandava — the cosmic dance to end the universe.', 'But Sati has also lent her name to one of the most terrible practices — the system of Sati, suggesting that grief is ultimately destructive, that good wives should follow their husbands to the grave — that is how this story has been interpreted, by some.', 'But I think it is meant to offer us a different realisation, a more hopeful one — that, in time, love will return, grief — no matter how painful — will be healed, and the world will be made whole again.', 'The episode of Kama and Rati, also linked to the story of Shiva, Sati and Parvati, suggests this.', 'Shiva grieves, but in time Sati is reborn as Parvati, and the Gods are desperate for Shiva to fall in love with her, and for their union to result in a child who will slay the demon Taraka. To hasten things along, Kama and Rati are dispatched to make Shiva fall in love. But Shiva opens his third eye and burns Kama to ashes.', 'Rati, like Demeter, and like Shiva, is possessed by grief and is inconsolable. Yet, unlike all those women who have been persuaded to immolate themselves on the pyres of their dead husband, Rati holds on. In some stories, she tries to, but the Gods stop her, for she must — she has to — live. She is promised that her husband will return, that he will be reborn. So she lives and waits.', 'And in time, like how each year Persephone reunites with Demeter, and how Shiva falls in love again, Rati too finds that her love returns. Some stories suggest that Shiva resurrects Kama; others that Rati, through the power of her penance, resurrects him; still others claim that he is reborn as Pradyumna, the son of Krishna and Rukmini.', 'But the ending is the same — what was once lost is now found again.', 'The writer is the author of ‘The Mahabharatha - A Child’s View,’ ‘Sita’ s Ramayana’ and ‘The Missing Queen’']"
New Delhi,"['Petals and flowers, moon and stars lend themselves to poetry. Not so brutalities of man, the cruelties imposed in the name of religion and region, ideals and ideology. Blood and tears, fear and grief are all for prose, poetry is all about tulips and roses. Well, not always. Why should all poetry be about feeling good, looking great? In sadness often resides the reality of life. As noted Urdu poet Shakeel Badayuni said more than 50 years ago, a heart that has experienced no sorrow, knows no love. Dnyaneshwar Mulay, a noted career bureaucrat, who has seldom allowed his writing skills to take a backseat amidst all policy deliberations, recently came up with a book of poetry. More appropriately, Hindi kavitayen in a Hindi book suitably titled “Shanti ki Afwahein”. The poems rankle, provoke, even hurt, but in the end force the reader to do some introspection about the times we live in, about the crimes we commit.', ""Often, it is said, the cover of the book is misleading. It certainly holds no water here as the very title makes it clear that there can be whispers, even rumours of peace, but not peace itself. After all, we are living in the age of terror and trauma, an age when Baghdad's illustrious history is all forgotten as Iraq struggles to get rid of ISIS and the cruelties inflicted in the name of religion. Here, Mulay makes sure to do justice to Baghdad's doctors who were often caught in the crossfire as the country reeled under the aftermath of terrorism and fight with terrorism. In a poem titled “Aspatalo se Bhagte Doctor” he brings home the pathos of the doctors who are often blamed for a patient's death. The doctor may be hailed as deities in Hindi poetry, here though they are portrayed as helpless victims, doomed if they save a patient, doomed if they fail."", 'In the poem “Shanti ke Afwahein,” the poet leaves a lot unsaid but not unexpressed. His few lines take a dig at the electoral process in the strife-torn Palestine; it is the matter between the lines that conveys what is vital. Locating his poem in present day events while drawing richly from the past, Mulay writes, “Chal rahi hai kya hawa kuchh nai si/Ab shanti ki afwahein phael rahin hain/Kuchh toh chal raha hai/Ek chunao hone ja raha hai/ek naya mahaul banta ja raha hai/bade-bade posters lage hain/Gaza ke char hazaar niwasi/ kahin aur chale jayenge/ Aur Hamas ki bandooke chup ho jayengi/kuchh samay ke liye....” Without pointing fingers as Israel or Palestine, the poet proves everything to be done according to political expedience.', 'In yet another poem, “Bandhak hai Kavita”, he expresses the anguish of the poet in modern day. The times we live in, the age characterised by bombs and suicide bombers, terrorism of the individual and the State, do not lend themselves to', 'poetry; the medium is itself struggling to breath. As Mulay says it all succinctly, “Thhak kar soi hai kavita/Ya behosh ho gayi hai/kehna mushkil hai/Ye har din ki wardaatein/aatmghaati bamo ka visfot/Ye hinsa ki khabrein/Sehna mushkil hai/So gayi hai kavita/Ya kho gayi hai/Kehna mushkil hai”. He takes a dig at things, crassly commerical in modern timnes. It includes too news being sponsored today in a poem “Saanse Ho Jayengi Prayojit”. It is a kavita that will lend itself to easy reading for many generations. Without being profound, he goes beyond the surface to say a few things that need need to be said.', ""Interestingly, Mulay takes a few liberties with the language here, preferring to use everything language and vocabulary rather than pure Hindi. For instance, he uses a word like 'posters' rather than 'poster' or 'vighyapan'. Similarly, he uses a word like 'jannatein' rather than 'swarg'. All these liberties though lend greater value to the book. And tells the reader that Mulay is no prisoner of the language. Hardly, a surprise considering this career diplomat calls Marathi his mother tongue, and write with relish in English as well. “Shanti ki Afwahein” has come not a day too late. Or too soon. It is timed just right.""]"

Famous tawaif, Akhtarjaan is singing, sitting at some distance, hoping that her singing will sooth Dagh’s ailing nerves.

His journey of life and development of his poetic genius are depicted through flashback scenes. The action shifts from the present to the past and vice verse. This device imparts intricacy to the narrative and a sense of suspense. In this process, he gives glimpses of his life in Lal Quila when his mother re-married Mughal crown prince Mirza Muhammad Fakhroo after her husband was hanged. We know about his life at Rampur Estate after he and his mother left Lal Quila in 1856 looking after horses and finally his stay at Hyderabad where he died at the age of 75. The production gives us the sense of the turbulent time before and after 1857, the First Indian War of Independence, in which the poet lived and wrote poems.', 'Director Dr. Alam has innovatively designed his production with downstage right setting the present and the past is unfolded in the centre stage and upstage.', 'In the lead role of Dagh, Dr. M. Sayeed Alam creates a convincing portrait of his character who has led a life of struggle, attaining heights of popularity as a poet and at the last moment of life revealing his past, making great efforts to speak.

Amma would teach us all day, humming tunes while cooking, quizzing us on different musical concepts,” Deeptha smiles.

Vasanth Kumar. The progress in music happily overlapped with their academic achievements.', 'While Shwetha turned to law, Deeptha is pursuing medicine. It was a challenge, to manage their time to accommodate their creative passion. “We never felt the stress though,” says Shwetha, attributing it to their mother’s positive outlook and the conducive environment she fostered at home.', '“For us, music was an outlet. With mother encouraging us to pursue whatever career we desired, it was left to us to create a space for music,” Deeptha adds.', 'Living apart for the first time, the girls practised over phone. This in a way prepared them for their intense careers ahead — giving them an edge as they call it. But they do share something special.', '“We complement each other,” Deeptha shrugs as Shwetha smiles in agreement. It is a partnership that has served them well, even resulting in the composition of a few ragam-tanam-pallavis and duo kutcheris every Season even as Deeptha prepares for her AIIMS board exams next month.', '“We invite our colleagues to our performances.

The Margazhi festival began in 1927, with the Music Academy pioneering the December conference and concerts a year later. At least two great composers — Papanasam Sivan and Koteeswara Iyer were from here.', 'But then, Chennai’s music is not just Carnatic alone. The Sarva Deva Vilasa, a 19th century Sanskrit work on the city paints a picture of a thriving cultural metropolis with singers, dancers, pipers and drummers being active participants in processions, soirees and concerts. In Madras, it was customary for a man of status to be surrounded by musicians wherever he went in the city, noted the English. And they too joined in. Events of great importance to Madras, such as the granting of a charter for starting a Corporation (India’s oldest) in 1688, were occasions for much dancing and performing of country music. Devadasis and musicians accompanied the charter as it was taken around Fort St George. The English brought in Western classical music and we took to that too, ‘Carnaticising’ the violin and carrying on with the institutions they left behind such as the Madras Musical Association and Musee Musicals.', 'News dissemination', 'The lives of the common folk too appears to have been full of music. Memoirs of personalities such as Dr K.N. Kesari carry vivid descriptions of street performers, who excelled in music. A.R. Venkatachalapathy’s Songsters of the Crossroads deals with how in the early 20th century news was disseminated in Madras via chapbooks the contents of which were publicised by musicians singing them at street junctions. Songs on the Great Park Town Fire, the construction of the High Court, the Arubathu Moovar festival and the bombing of Madras by the Emden abound in these publications. For that matter, printing books on music began as early as 1859 in Madras and has continued ever since.', 'Theatre was an important source of music. The Parsi Theatre, chiefly the Balivala Troupe did a lot to popularise light classical North Indian tunes in Madras and these gradually entered Tamil theatre as Parsi varnamettus. Tamil theatre by itself was heavily musical with a whole lot of stars such as K.B. Sundarambal, M.K. Thyagaraja Bhagavatar, S.G. Kittappa and Golden Saradambal. The plays of Sankaradas Swamigal are embellished with wonderful songs.', 'Woman sound engineer', 'Tamil Cinema began talking (and singing) in 1931 and Madras became a production capital not long after. The first woman sound recording engineer, Meenakshi Narayanan, was from here. Much experimentation with various types of music went on in the studios of the city and Saluri Rajeswara Rao of Gemini is generally credited with introducing western tunes into south Indian cinema. The contributions of composers such as Viswanathan-Ramamurthy, Ilaiyaraja and A.R. Rahman are renowned the world over. It is also significant that till the 1980s, songs in all South Indian languages were recorded here, the films being made here as well.', 'The gramophone industry flourished here for long and Madras was a major production centre. Formal recording began here in 1905, making some singers such as Coimbatore Thayi internationally recognised. The non-classical variety — songs of daily life were also an important genre that sold well, as did film songs.', 'Chennai always had its own folk idiom. The fishermen were the first residents here and their music was commented on by the British. Then came the songs of the oarsmen who plied rafts from shore to Madras Roads, the spot in the sea where the ships berthed before we got a harbour. Today we have Gana Pattu, unique to our city, in Madras bhashai, the city’s own lingo.', 'This was where Ramalinga Swamigal sang of ‘Dharmamigu Chennai.’ Above all, who can forget Subramania Bharati, perhaps the most musical among Indian poets? He and others like him gave us freedom music as a genre too.', 'Now, is Chennai unique among Indian cities to merit this UNESCO tag? Maybe not. And will this tag make any difference? Probably not. We will carry on the way we are. The reaction in Chennai has been twofold — claiming credit for it being the first, completely denying any qualification for such a recognition being the second. Why not acknowledge a compliment and accept it gracefully? Indian cities rarely make it to the news for anything good, and when that happens, let us celebrate it.', '', 'Theatre was an important source of music.

Since then, I have worked relentlessly to keep our tradition alive and thriving, along with many other musicians. Over the years, I have seen our music expand to many corners of the world, reaching newer audiences while always remaining rooted to its home, Chennai.', 'It is quite amazing to think that the Margazhi festival or the ‘December Music Season’ as it is fondly referred to, first started in 1927. Aside from the musicians, the sabhas have played a pivotal role in ensuring that the spirit of Margazhi is captured in all its glory with each passing year.', 'The first on the list is the Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha, which began as early as 1896, by Mani Tirumalachariar. Launched as the Sangeetha Vidwat Sabha in 1900, it was rechristened as Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha.', 'Another great example is the Madras Music Academy, which had its humble beginnings staging performances under a pandal. Today, it has grown exponentially into one of India’s premier institutions for the performing arts.', 'Let us not forget Tamil Isai Sangam, another pioneering institution that was born out of the efforts of Raja Sir Annamalai Chettiar, who sought to revive interest in the forgotten works of Tamil poets, in 1953. Subsequently, other sabhas came into being.', 'It was not only Carnatic music that drew big crowds; Harikatha and Bhakti Sangeetham played a huge role in attracting large audiences. Classical music made its way into the film industry as well. Bharatanatyam queens such as T. Balasaraswati, the Travancore sisters, Kumari Kamala, and Vyjayanthimala Bali were outstanding performers.', '', 'Each year, the Margazhi season evolves, becoming bigger and better — growing in number and size of events, with new and talented performing artistes and the many cafeterias serving delicious snacks. A staggering amount of labour and coordination goes into making this event a success.', 'Recognition deserved', 'During this time, our beloved city brings so many people together — musicians, teachers, musicologists, natya exponents, students, technicians, and event organisers. I’m thrilled that we are finally receiving the global recognition that an annual event like Margazhi deserves.', 'An Advisory Body on Intangible Cultural Heritage & Diverse Cultural Traditions of India (ABICHU), was created by the Ministry of Culture to facilitate application for this recognition. As a member of this Advisory Body, I can attest to the dedication and focus of this group’s work towards achieving this status.', 'However, while we celebrate this achievement, we must also set our sights on the future. It is time to invest in institutions that will preserve the legacy of Carnatic music — such as a museum, which will amplify the history of Carnatic music with past legends’ memorabilia, and a world-class school exclusively for music and other arts.', 'To fully embody the spirit of this honour, Chennaiites must continue to support and encourage the development and education of the next generation of artistes and rasikas that will carry Carnatic music to newer heights — our music can only live on through them.', 'Jai Hind!', '', 'As a member of the Advisory Body, I can attest to the dedication and focus of the group’s work towards achieving this status!', '', 'Aside from the musicians, the ‘sabhas’ have played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Marghazhi Season continues in full glory']"

Karthik Ananth Subramanian as sutradhar helped in linking the tale.', 'The imageries of flora and fauna and the depiction of ashrams on the banks of the Ganga added an edge to the presentation. It was to the credit of the quick-footed dancers, who made the first act, describing the Ganga, visually appealing, but the segment was a tad too long. Crisp editing would have enhanced the impact.', 'The sound of the river beating against the rocks was conveyed by dancers clapping their palms, with occasional Odissi-like movements and Kathak swirls. A blue dupatta was used to depict the coursing river, Brahma-Vishnu-Siva poses and two dancers as horses were visuals that stayed with the audience.', 'Story of king Shantanu', 'The story of King Shantanu, who was bewitched by damsel Ganga was portrayed briefly. The tale of Ashwamedha yagna performed by King Sagar of Ikshvaku dynasty unfolded in detail. From a jealous Indra hiding the horse in sage Kapila’s hermitage; the king’s 60,000 sons being burnt to ashes by the sage; the subsequent repentance of Anshuman and penance by Bhagiratha seeking salvation for them brings Ganga down to earth with such force that it makes Bhagiratha pray to Siva, who locks her in his matted tresses and then loosens one lock to let her flow down.', 'Nidheesh Kumar as Siva was agile and Jaikrishnan proved to be convincing as Bhagiratha.

Their folk dance is so vibrant that I decided to incorporate it,” informed Revathi.', 'In the opening scene, the Ganga’s flow was captured in ascending and descending notes. According to the mood of the scene, the musical score alternated between being lively and mellow. Inclusion of a Tamil song and Hindi bhajan towards the end, chanting of Rudram, the sounds of the udukkai in Siva tandavam, all stood testimony to the thought invested in the musical score.', 'Light and smoke effect', 'The play of light and the smoke-effect enhanced the scenes, except when the latter was used a bit too much affecting visual clarity. Costumes in muted colours and the terracotta jewelry looked unconventional and elegant.', 'Significant messages such as the ill-effects of effluence and water pollution were woven well into the presentation.', 'Tillana in a semi-circular formation and the solo segment by Revathi stood out.

The story (by Gowri Ramnarayan, who has also directed it) traces his efforts to save the tiger from poachers. He ropes in the tribals for this task and soon the operation escalates into an absorbing clash of love, betrayal and passion involving a slew of characters.

I had to go beyond my comfort zone — the written and spoken word — and fully embrace stylised gesture and movement as integral to my character’s communication.

Nothing grows.', 'Finally, the gods pressure Hades to return Persephone to Demeter.

Shiva’s grief leads to rage. Holding Sati’s body, in a frenzy of grief, He begins the tandava — the cosmic dance to end the universe.', 'But Sati has also lent her name to one of the most terrible practices — the system of Sati, suggesting that grief is ultimately destructive, that good wives should follow their husbands to the grave — that is how this story has been interpreted, by some.', 'But I think it is meant to offer us a different realisation, a more hopeful one — that, in time, love will return, grief — no matter how painful — will be healed, and the world will be made whole again.', 'The episode of Kama and Rati, also linked to the story of Shiva, Sati and Parvati, suggests this.', 'Shiva grieves, but in time Sati is reborn as Parvati, and the Gods are desperate for Shiva to fall in love with her, and for their union to result in a child who will slay the demon Taraka. To hasten things along, Kama and Rati are dispatched to make Shiva fall in love. But Shiva opens his third eye and burns Kama to ashes.', 'Rati, like Demeter, and like Shiva, is possessed by grief and is inconsolable. Yet, unlike all those women who have been persuaded to immolate themselves on the pyres of their dead husband, Rati holds on.

Chennai,"['One cannot possibly go to Britannia & Co in Ballard Estate in Mumbai and not relish the signature mutton or chicken berry\npulao\n. This sweet-sour fragrant pilaf rice layered with chunks of mutton or chicken swathed in a rich, spiced tomato sauce, topped with sour berries, crunchy cashews and sweet, sticky caramelised onions, is the piece de resistance on their menu.', 'And while it may seem that this Indo-Iranian Parsi dish has been a part of this café ever since it was started in 1923, it was actually introduced by Bachan Kohinoor, the late wife of 94-year-old Boman Kohinoor, the current owner of this legendary restaurant. Continental food was what Britannia & Co was synonymous with, ever since it was started by Boman’s father, Rashid, in 1923. “The British naturally did not want spicy food, so we catered to their palates,” says Boman.', 'It was only after Independence that some Mughlai fare was made part of the menu, as they did not feel the need to serve Continental food only. After retirement, Boman’s wife took an active interest in the restaurant and infused her Parsi touch into the menu. Her personal recipes were shared with the chefs and are followed till date. Berry\npulao\n, chicken\ndhansak\n,\nsali boti\n, fish\npatra\nand caramel custard became a part of the offerings here and are still the fastest selling items.', '“Gradually, once the British left, we did away with the Continental dishes and included spicy Parsi and Mughlai dishes for our diners,” Boman quips.', 'Tweaking a legacy', 'He further reminisces, “In those days, berry\npulao\nwas made of soft fluffy rice, tender meat or chicken and imported Irani zereshk berries. It was priced at a measly Rs. 45 a plate. My wife tweaked the recipe she had sampled when posted in Tehran and created her own version, which soon became the high point of our restaurant. Owing to inflation, the price of mutton berry\npulao\nis Rs. 750 a plate today.”', 'Like many other Zoroastrian immigrants from Iran, Rashid Kohinoor came to Bombay and decided to get into the restaurant business. His son Boman has been involved in the running of Britannia since he was 16 years old, as he had to step in when his father died in 1939 in an accident. Although Boman still comes daily to the restaurant, his son Afshin looks into the running of the restaurant. Boman is happy taking orders, talking to his guests and regaling them with colourful old stories.', 'He revels in the nostalgia and accolades Britannia has received over the years. On a wall, cultural tributes, which Boman is immensely proud of, preside. A painting of Queen Elizabeth II is next to a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi, both hanging beneath a gilt-framed picture of Zarathustra, the Zoroastrian prophet worshipped by the Parsis. He further shows off to his guests the letter he has received from Her Majesty’s office. These are his priceless treasures.', 'Dreams come true', 'The highlight of his life, he feels, was when his dream to meet Prince William and Kate, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, came true and he actually got a chance to see them.', 'Making money has never been Boman’s mantra. Small wonder then that the restaurant opens daily for four hours only, for dinner on Saturdays and remains closed on Sundays.', 'The Bentwood furniture imported by his father is still a part of the restaurant, but Boman confesses, “This place was very sophisticated and posh back then. Now it is simple and ordinary.”', 'Content with his limited menu offerings, Boman does not feel the need to make additions. “Guests come here for their favourite dishes; so why complicate matters by introducing more. Let us continue to serve these well,” he states, matter-of-factly.', 'No compromises', 'Their food may appear more expensive than some other Irani cafés, but Boman emphasises they use only fresh, good quality ingredients and never compromise on anything. Competition has never bothered him, as he is confident of his food and knows he has a loyal clientèle. “We have people coming from abroad regularly to dine here and some even carry back our food,” he says proudly. He adds, “An air hostess flying to London used to carry 100\nchapatis\nwith her as she loved the soft, fluffy\nchapatis\nwe make.”', 'The fame that Britannia enjoys in Mumbai and even in other parts of the country and world is what he holds dear. “Patrons come here from all over the globe, and after eating our food, write about it in the media. That is how we have gained word-of-mouth publicity. Else we have never advertised,” he declares with pride.', 'One of the last Irani restaurants in Mumbai, Boman has given almost 80 years of his life to this place and wants it to continue forever. “I want the family legacy to continue, that’s all,” he says. He is hopeful his grandson Daanish, who is still quite young, will step in, but is realistic too. “It is not possible for one person to manage Britannia.

Chennai,"['It’s 8 pm in Goa and it’s quite likely that the verandah of an old Goan house will be chock full of people. One may wonder on seeing it. But the smell of fresh baked Goan bread that wafts in the air will make you realise that this tiny house is actually a bakery and these people are gathered to get their daily bread.', 'Usually baked fresh twice a day (in the mornings and evenings), this bread is sold by the ‘poder’ on his bicycle. In fact, it isn’t uncommon to spot him cycle down residential localities with a big cane basket full of bread covered with tarpaulin to protect the ware from heat, dust and rains. For many Goans, the poder’s early morning cycle bell is a wake-up call of sorts. Priced at a modest Rs. 3 to Rs. 5, this bread is as quintessentially Goan as are its robust balchaos and cafreals.', 'Steeped in history', 'You may wonder, what’s so special about this Goan bread? Well, everything. Right from the way it is made, baked, and variety to the fact that it is also steeped in history.', 'It is believed that the Portuguese Jesuit priests taught the Goans how to bake bread. The hard-working Goans learnt the art quickly enough and the Goan\npao\nwas born. The word\npao\nis a Portuguese term for bread. But, some believe that it is a quarter of a loaf and that’s why it is known as\npao\n. A standing joke is that the poders would knead the dough with their legs and thus the name\npao\n(Hindi word for legs).', 'What’s in a shape', 'This bread comes in a variety of shapes and sizes. The most common one is the\npoiee\n(made from wheat flour and husk), which resembles a pita;\npao\n(soft variety);\nunndo\n(this has a hard crust and slit in between);\nkatro pao\n(soft bread shaped like a butterfly) and\nkakon\n(a circular bangle-shaped hard bread which is typically dipped in hot tea).', 'Each bread is paired with specific dishes. For example, dishes with a coconut gravy, such as chicken xacuti and mixed vegetable gravy, are eaten with either\npao\n,\npoiee\nor\nunndo\n. The other items like the\nchorusa pao\n,\nkanda bhaji/kapa\n(onion and potato pakoras),\nrass\nomelet with\npao\nare hot favourites for evening snacks. However, the ideal way to eat these breads is to toast them with butter and top with a sprinkling of sugar; a perfect snack.', 'In Goa, you will find the traditional bakeries not only in villages but also in towns and cities. According to All Goa Bakers Association, there are 300 registered bakers, but the unofficial number could be around 1,000. Their dark, dusty interiors are hot and humid, and you will come across bakers who do nothing but bake bread day and night. Typically, a bakery sells around 1,500 to 2,500 pieces of bread a day.', 'They start the process by pre-heating the oven, which takes a few hours. The dough is made from\nmaida\n, yeast, sugar and water. Completely handmade, there are no preservatives involved, and it is baked in a traditional wood-fired oven; a dome-like structure made from mud and bricks. For heat, firewood and coconut husk are traditionally used.', 'The tipsy baker', 'Researcher and writer, Maria de Lourdes Bravo da Costa Rodrigues, mentions that the basic technique of making bread is the same, except for one ingredient, which is toddy. “Earlier, as yeast was not available, bakers used toddy for fermentation. Toddy made the bread more flavourful and tasty.”', 'But these days, palm toddy is not as easily available, as there are hardly any toddy tappers left in Goa. But venture into some of the South Goa villages and you might just stumble across a baker still using toddy to bake bread.', 'In the village of Velsao in South Goa, the bakery owned by Pedro Anton Fernandes is probably one of the few remaining ones where toddy is used to ferment the dough. Sheras Fernandes, a regular customer here, says, “Adding toddy to the dough not only makes it tastier, but also increases the shelf life of the bread. It stays fresh for more than two days.”', 'In fact, so celebrated is\npao\nin Goa that there’s an annual Poderachem Fest or Bakers Festival that is held in the village of Succour in North Goa. It is the time when bread lovers and bakers come together to help keep this baking tradition alive.', '', 'The word\npao\nis a Portuguese term for bread. But, some believe that it is a quarter of a loaf and that’s why it is known as\npao', '', 'Wood’s the trick', 'It is believed that wood-fired ovens boost the flavour of food. There is a significant difference in taste in food cooked in a wood-fired oven and an electric one. This is largely due to the even distribution of heat and the unique smoky flavour the food imbibes from the burning of wood.']"
Chennai,"['An extraordinary journeyFr Cedric Boutspecial arrangement', 'Above the roar of the rain outside, I hear Father Bout’s steady shuffle, as he is led into the parlour at Citadel, the Provincial House of the Salesians of Don Bosco in Chennai. In Kilpauk, where until a decade ago, Fr Bout walked the tree-lined roads engaging with students, passers-by and children, he is seen as a jolly priest whose humour and affable nature are strengthened by his spirituality. The deep pockets of his white cassock held sweets, rubber lizards and small plastic toys that little boys and girls, especially from the slums, helped themselves to unabashedly, in the years when the world was a kinder, gentler and less-judgemental place.', 'In 1940, Fr Bout joined the Salesian Society founded in the late 19th Century by the Italian priest John Bosco, that works with youth, especially the poor. Most of Fr Bout’s active years were spent in the field of education — as headmaster of the Salesian schools in Vellore, Madras (St Gabriel’s and St Mary’s), Katpadi, Mumbai and Mannuthy (Kerala). “I had a tough time keeping snakes away from the boys, and vice versa, in the green environs of the school,” he says, in a voice tremulous with laughter.', 'Born Cedric Anthony Bout on Armistice Day — November 11, 1918, that marked the end of the First World War — in Kapu, near Mangalore, he is the first in the Salesian community in India to touch the centenary milestone. Father Bout hails from old Anglo-Indian stock in Tangasseri (Quilon), his childhood with his five siblings coloured by the customs of British India. “My father John Henry Bout was an engineer in the Directorate-General of Lighthouses, maintaining lighthouses in India, Burma and Ceylon. My earliest childhood memory is of living in a house near the sea in Muttom, South India, when I was two-and-a-half years old. My father was posted there, and I remember running down to the shore and then running all the way back in terror because I saw a snake. It was an adventure that ended in tears — I hurt myself on an iron railing. I wanted to go back — my baby brother is buried there — but never had a chance,” he says wistfully.', 'As Fr Bout grew up, Roman Catholicism was as binding a part of family life as the lighthouses that light up his earliest memories. He started school at St Aloysius, Vepery, followed it up with St Joseph’s, where he gained a double promotion, and completed his education at the Salesian-run St Mary’s. “The Bout family tree is scattered with priests. Attending daily mass was routine,” he says, admitting that when he decided to become a priest, there was no epiphany. “When I graduated from Loyola College in 1938, I wanted to join Madras Medical College.” But, in a quirk of fate, his parish priest introduced him to Fr Carreno, Rector of the Salesian House in Tirupattur, who was in Madras at that time. Fr Bout packed his belongings in a trunk that belonged to his sister and left for Tirupattur, a long road that ended when he was ordained a priest in 1949. “I still have that trunk,” he says, adding, “I was the only graduate among the novices there. Most of them were Italians; some were interned by the Government during the Second World War. I prepared many of them for the graduate exams conducted by Calcutta University. When I first went to Tirupattur, my duties were to water the garden. It was a place full of monkeys which stole bananas.”', 'Father Bout learned to play the violin and once ordered sheets of music from the US, something he could ill afford. “I paid through money order from money saved from my bus fare. Once, when I defaulted, I was issued a legal notice,” he chuckles.', 'With a steely determination to get a good deal for his students, Fr Bout used to pay a man to travel from Madras to his school at Katpadi to screen films loaned by the US Consulate. Today, Fr Bout spends his day at mass, reading both spiritual and secular books, and playing Solitaire on his computer. He is also a discerning gourmet. “I love hoppers and stew and Iruttukadai halwa,” he says, breaking open a packet of the famed sweet from Tirunelveli. He offers me some, and long after I’ve turned the corner on the quiet corridor, I can hear the crackle of the foil.', '', 'Most of Fr Bout’s active years were spent in the field of education — as headmaster of the Salesian schools', '', 'To the lighthouse', '', 'Tangasseri Lighthouse is one of two lighthouses in the Kollam Metropolitan Area and has been in operation since 1902.

The gallery, known for the support it offered to young and struggling artists, closed down earlier this year. “We worked there together for almost 18 years,” says Senthilkumar.', 'The Soul Spice Art Gallery was started with the same motive: to showcase the work of younger artists who struggle to find platforms to showcase their work. “Most large galleries prefer to showcase the work of already-established artists. But there are thousands of artists graduating from art school every year. Where do they go?,” he asks.', 'A walk through the gallery — a small 500 square foot space — throws up some interesting surprises.

He finds that most jobs offer nothing to new to learn from, beyond the sixth month. “After that, all you’re doing is competing with colleagues there.”', 'But it took him a year and a half before he quit cinema. The reason he did, however, was the opposite. “There was just too much to learn... too many challenges. It was overwhelming.” He returned to cinema soon, after arguing that it’s a world that’s impossible to leave once you’ve stepped in. He joined director Raju Murugan (\nCuckoo\n,\nJoker\n) and found his own voice in the industry, making a film that’s largely inspired from real-life incidents.', 'Based on a crime', 'Even\nTheeran Adhigaaram Ondru\n, his second after\nSathuranga Vettai\n, is inspired by real life. Based on a sensational and gruesome crime, it’s an idea that kept haunting Vinoth.', '“I had worked on a one-liner based on this particular crime long ago. I then kept it aside, as I got busy with\n\nSathuranga Vettai\n\nand I’d forgotten about it. Then one day, I had parcelled some food and brought it home, to see that it was packed in a newspaper with the exact same news clipping in it. It was a coincidence, but it took me back to that script and I started reworking it obsessively.”', 'From a road trip, the script then evolved into a police story. Written specifically for Karthi, he says it worked better that the script is seen from a cop’s perspective rather than a regular person’s.', '“It’s easier to write a script based on real life, because we get real, raw scenes that are brimming with drama. For\nTheeran Adhigaaram Ondru\n, we had to water down many real moments, because they would have been too violent and the censors wouldn’t have liked it. And then, we also spoil these wonderful moments by adding commercial elements like a love track to it.”', 'These compromises, he says, are something every director has to live with. Despite giving a hit film, he says the struggle is just the same.', '“Earlier, if Sachin scored a hundred, you know his place in the team is cemented for the next 10 matches. But it’s not the same any more and that extends to the film world as well. You may have made a hit film, but you still need a watertight script to get your next chance.”', 'Scaling up', 'But things have become better. After a hit, producers “are willing to trust you a bit more and give you a bigger budget. But it’s not like you can take the advance for three films and then start writing them, like what was done earlier.”', 'His\nSathuranga Vettai\nwas filled with compromises; “the final film was just 10% of the original vision.” Initially planned as a film divided into six chapters, with each chapter set within a specific geography, a dialect and a colour tone, much of it had to be compromised due to budget constraints.', '“But in your second film, you get a bit more to get closer to your vision. In\nTheeran Adhigaaram Ondru\n, I was able to shoot in places where I’d originally planned to, instead of cheating every terrain in Chennai. When that’s the case, you get to experience all that your characters go through.”', 'It also helped that he’s got a star this time. “If all the people who watched\nSathuranga Vettai\nhad actually gone to the theatres, it would have been a much bigger hit. That’s what you need a star for.”', '‘Dialogue film’ v/s ‘visual film’', 'What worked for him in\n\nSathuranga Vettai\n,\nhe believes\n,\nwas that it was primarily a ‘dialogue film’. “You may have planned a lot of things for your first film, but most of it gets lost because you hardly get a budget. But that’s not the case when you have good dialogues. A good line connects even if you shoot that in a cheap setting. That’s why 99% of our films work just as well even if we watch it with our eyes closed.”', 'But he’s quick to argue that visual films are more important. “I know that the great directors are those who make ‘visual’ films. They rely on images to speak more than their dialogues, and I know I haven’t made those kinds of films yet. But directors alone can’t be blamed for that. If the audience had supported at least a few visual films, we would have had dozens of such films and directors here.”', '', 'Earlier, if Sachin scored a hundred, you know his place in the team is cemented for the next 10 matches.

Take, for instance, what happened at Chennai-based pub, The Velveteen Rabbit, recently when city-based poets and one of Australia’s contemporary greats took to the mic one by one.', 'Organised by the Australian High Commission, in association with Stray Factory and The Spoken Word, the evening began with short musical performances by Pooja Prakash Raj, Arjun Shah and Jose Selvaraj, followed by Bhargav Prasad offering light takes on love, life and the existential struggles of a limerick. Prasad kept the audience swaying between poignancy and laughter, at times blending both. He was followed by Ishvar Krishnan, co-founder of the Mockingbirds Poetry Club, whose shrewd observances and able delivery won the audience over. The highlight was Michelle Ann James, also co-founder of Mockingbirds, whose recital was equal parts powerful, introspective celebratory and defiantly feminist. One minute, the audience was laughing and empathising with a limerick; the next, they were devastated about life, death and abuse; and soon enough, they were cheering in celebration of “grabbing patriarchy by the beard” and making it pay for every man, woman and child it has ever victimised.', 'But that’s exactly what poetry is supposed to do. “The best humour can still be serious: you start out with the humour, get the audience laughing, and then you undercut it with something that makes them think,” explains Merrill, poet, performer, co-writer and co-director of Slamming for Sydney Festival. He paints a mental image of a knife turning in their chest, as the still-laughing audience struggles to understand what’s happening to them.', 'At a poetry slam, there are no restrictions in terms of structure or content. “It could be a poem, a story, a monologue, but essentially, it’s a competition,” says Merrill, adding that it’s all just a platform for “someone who’s performing the spoken word.”', 'Merrill notes that a lot of politics and contemporary issues are coming up in poetry slams, and sees a clear reason for it. “That’s mainly because there aren’t that many artistic outlets for people who come from more marginalised communities: they don’t see themselves reflected in television; they don’t get through the gatekeepers that are editors and casting directors... If you’ve got the ability to just write, and then speak in front of a live audience, it’s a bit liberating,” he says, “If you’re young and brown, and most of what we consume is white and middle-aged, it feels liberating to get up and speak, and be heard.”', '', 'At a poetry slam, there are no restrictions in terms of structure or content']"

Munidasa says, “The cost or pricing of such dinners is relative to what we serve. It is a challenge to bring many ingredients into India and that challenge is augmented by a higher cost, hence the dinners can become expensive. Then again, the same is true for Sri Lanka, where the import duties are so high that if you want to use interesting ingredients from overseas, it ends up being very expensive. Until governments change policy on these matters, we as restaurateurs are helpless when it comes to controlling prices.”', 'While most of these pop ups sell out out quickly owing to the popularity of the chef and his/her cuisine, the real prize for hotels hosting them, is the cachet that comes from being associated with a celebrity chef.

Chennai,"['Potent mixMost action sequences in books are either preceded or followed by a drink', 'I was introduced to the beautiful world of alcohol through books. My dad, an aficionado of dark rum, allowed me to read the popular books in his library when I was about 15. I loved those books — mostly crime and detective fiction — where every action, whether with the gun or after the characters had undressed, had to be preceded by a scene where alcohol was sampled, because alcohol is a plot-thickening tool.', 'Raymond Chandler famously said, “When in doubt, have a man come through a door with a gun in his hand.” I would like to rephrase: “When in doubt, have a man or a woman drink an extra few pegs.” Guns and alcohol, much like good women and bad men, were the sure-fire ingredients of all the engaging crime novels that I’d read.', 'One of my earliest influences was Ian Fleming: the suave James Bond usually had a drink in one hand — martini, shaken not stirred — and a hot girl in the other. As I reflect upon this today, perhaps because the act of drinking preceded that of making out, I was prompted to try drinking when I was just 16. There were other reasons too. My dad once asked me to take a sip of rum from his tumbler, and when I made a face at the awful taste, he asked me to take a bite from an omelette he was eating, before the next sip. That was a winning combination, and to date, on rare winter evenings when I long for rum, my mind turns to that omelette.', 'But blaming dad for my later years of fighting alcoholism would be diluting my own mistakes. An unlimited access to books and movies when I worked on ships later, were the real reasons that took me downhill, polluting in the process, my rational thinking. As I moved to the officer’s mess via the academy on completion of my training, alcohol continued to heighten the often mundane life, particularly the evenings. I tried cocktails that I had read about in books, learnt how to pair\ntandoori\nmeats and mess food with wines in place of mignon steaks that I had often read about, and learnt about the appropriate crystal ware. During my alcohol-fuelled years, I had several near breakdown moments. I fought depression, could barely focus on work, and had become that pessimistic guy whom everyone wanted to avoid. But I was lucky and my boat of sanity kept righting itself after every such ordeal. Besides a loving family, there was Hemingway, of course.', 'Ernest Hemingway might have been a bad influence on many, but not me. Let me elaborate. It’s no secret that alcohol was not just his lifeblood, but he had also extended the habit to the characters he wrote about. In\nA Farewell to Arms,\nfor\n\nexample\n,\nFrederic Henry loved his martinis. In the short story,\nThe\nThree-Day Blow\n, Nick Adams, nursing a breakup with his girlfriend, enjoys whiskey, chatting with his friend, Bill. As a young officer, I remember reading that Hemingway never drank when he worked. In fact, he was quoted as saying that he could spot those who drank and wrote, in no time. This tiny fact kept me on track for many years, as I had also been groomed not to mix work and alcohol, something that I’ve scrupulously stuck to even after quitting a life in uniform in 2014.', 'While still in the service, however, as I moved from one unit to the other, it took me some time to develop a taste for Philip Marlowe, the hard-drinking, chess-loving detective created by Raymond Chandler. The books led me to watching movie adaptations and the taste for hard-boiled crime stayed on. In fact, almost all the short stories that I have written thrive on a noir-ish essence that is integral to the storytelling.', 'Not blaming here, but the gods, as stated in our ancient texts, have also kept the lure for alcohol strong for us, and I’m no exception. The other day, dealing with a hangover, my friend remarked, “It’s\nsomras yaar\n, even the gods drank it.” When I asked him if there was anything written on how to deal with a hangover in our religious texts, he smiled and whispered, “Two options: either start praying, or drink some more.”', 'I had his attention when I said there was a third option too, “Find out in the books of yore about how the gods dealt with alcoholism and hangover.”', 'The protagonists in Kulpreet Yadav’s spy thrillers are tough-thinking, alcohol-drinking men.

Continental food was what Britannia & Co was synonymous with, ever since it was started by Boman’s father, Rashid, in 1923. “The British naturally did not want spicy food, so we catered to their palates,” says Boman.', 'It was only after Independence that some Mughlai fare was made part of the menu, as they did not feel the need to serve Continental food only. After retirement, Boman’s wife took an active interest in the restaurant and infused her Parsi touch into the menu. Her personal recipes were shared with the chefs and are followed till date. Berry\npulao\n, chicken\ndhansak\n,\nsali boti\n, fish\npatra\nand caramel custard became a part of the offerings here and are still the fastest selling items.', '“Gradually, once the British left, we did away with the Continental dishes and included spicy Parsi and Mughlai dishes for our diners,” Boman quips.', 'Tweaking a legacy', 'He further reminisces, “In those days, berry\npulao\nwas made of soft fluffy rice, tender meat or chicken and imported Irani zereshk berries. It was priced at a measly Rs. 45 a plate. My wife tweaked the recipe she had sampled when posted in Tehran and created her own version, which soon became the high point of our restaurant. Owing to inflation, the price of mutton berry\npulao\nis Rs. 750 a plate today.”', 'Like many other Zoroastrian immigrants from Iran, Rashid Kohinoor came to Bombay and decided to get into the restaurant business. His son Boman has been involved in the running of Britannia since he was 16 years old, as he had to step in when his father died in 1939 in an accident. Although Boman still comes daily to the restaurant, his son Afshin looks into the running of the restaurant.

On a wall, cultural tributes, which Boman is immensely proud of, preside.

But the smell of fresh baked Goan bread that wafts in the air will make you realise that this tiny house is actually a bakery and these people are gathered to get their daily bread.', 'Usually baked fresh twice a day (in the mornings and evenings), this bread is sold by the ‘poder’ on his bicycle. In fact, it isn’t uncommon to spot him cycle down residential localities with a big cane basket full of bread covered with tarpaulin to protect the ware from heat, dust and rains. For many Goans, the poder’s early morning cycle bell is a wake-up call of sorts. Priced at a modest Rs. 3 to Rs. 5, this bread is as quintessentially Goan as are its robust balchaos and cafreals.', 'Steeped in history', 'You may wonder, what’s so special about this Goan bread? Well, everything. Right from the way it is made, baked, and variety to the fact that it is also steeped in history.', 'It is believed that the Portuguese Jesuit priests taught the Goans how to bake bread. The hard-working Goans learnt the art quickly enough and the Goan\npao\nwas born. The word\npao\nis a Portuguese term for bread. But, some believe that it is a quarter of a loaf and that’s why it is known as\npao\n. A standing joke is that the poders would knead the dough with their legs and thus the name\npao\n(Hindi word for legs).', 'What’s in a shape', 'This bread comes in a variety of shapes and sizes. The most common one is the\npoiee\n(made from wheat flour and husk), which resembles a pita;\npao\n(soft variety);\nunndo\n(this has a hard crust and slit in between);\nkatro pao\n(soft bread shaped like a butterfly) and\nkakon\n(a circular bangle-shaped hard bread which is typically dipped in hot tea).', 'Each bread is paired with specific dishes. For example, dishes with a coconut gravy, such as chicken xacuti and mixed vegetable gravy, are eaten with either\npao\n,\npoiee\nor\nunndo\n. The other items like the\nchorusa pao\n,\nkanda bhaji/kapa\n(onion and potato pakoras),\nrass\nomelet with\npao\nare hot favourites for evening snacks. However, the ideal way to eat these breads is to toast them with butter and top with a sprinkling of sugar; a perfect snack.', 'In Goa, you will find the traditional bakeries not only in villages but also in towns and cities. According to All Goa Bakers Association, there are 300 registered bakers, but the unofficial number could be around 1,000. Their dark, dusty interiors are hot and humid, and you will come across bakers who do nothing but bake bread day and night. Typically, a bakery sells around 1,500 to 2,500 pieces of bread a day.', 'They start the process by pre-heating the oven, which takes a few hours. The dough is made from\nmaida\n, yeast, sugar and water. Completely handmade, there are no preservatives involved, and it is baked in a traditional wood-fired oven; a dome-like structure made from mud and bricks. For heat, firewood and coconut husk are traditionally used.', 'The tipsy baker', 'Researcher and writer, Maria de Lourdes Bravo da Costa Rodrigues, mentions that the basic technique of making bread is the same, except for one ingredient, which is toddy. “Earlier, as yeast was not available, bakers used toddy for fermentation. Toddy made the bread more flavourful and tasty.”', 'But these days, palm toddy is not as easily available, as there are hardly any toddy tappers left in Goa. But venture into some of the South Goa villages and you might just stumble across a baker still using toddy to bake bread.', 'In the village of Velsao in South Goa, the bakery owned by Pedro Anton Fernandes is probably one of the few remaining ones where toddy is used to ferment the dough. Sheras Fernandes, a regular customer here, says, “Adding toddy to the dough not only makes it tastier, but also increases the shelf life of the bread. It stays fresh for more than two days.”', 'In fact, so celebrated is\npao\nin Goa that there’s an annual Poderachem Fest or Bakers Festival that is held in the village of Succour in North Goa. It is the time when bread lovers and bakers come together to help keep this baking tradition alive.', '', 'The word\npao\nis a Portuguese term for bread. But, some believe that it is a quarter of a loaf and that’s why it is known as\npao', '', 'Wood’s the trick', 'It is believed that wood-fired ovens boost the flavour of food. There is a significant difference in taste in food cooked in a wood-fired oven and an electric one. This is largely due to the even distribution of heat and the unique smoky flavour the food imbibes from the burning of wood.']"

The more people travel and have easier access to information, knowledge, and food, the more they want to see it on their home turf.”', 'Everything’s in a name', 'Marquee names matter to the Indian diner, and that is one of the biggest draws for the hotels too. Just about any chef for a pop up won’t do. Small wonder then, that Taj Hotels have always looked for heavyweights to bring in the crowds. Singh says, “We aim to bring the best, most exciting and different, culinary experiences for our guests.”', 'As part of the World Gourmet Festival, earlier this year, Four Seasons Hotel, Mumbai, too invited renowned chefs from across the globe to wow the palate of Indian diners.

Sometimes unique techniques and exotic ingredients are the focus of these meals; at other times, traditional family recipes are elevated to the level of haute cuisine.', 'Variety is the game', 'Chef Dwivedi of COYA says, “We were approached by The Taj and I jumped at the chance. The pop up transported guests to the heart of Latin America with a seafood-led menu that enabled guests to indulge in the best Peruvian cuisine, using modern European cooking techniques, and get a real taste of COYA.” Munidasa adds, “Globally, I think chefs are doing pop ups all over the world and it is a great way to showcase what we do for guests who cannot come to our restaurant.”', 'Pop ups are clearly a win-win for both chefs and diners.

Munidasa says, “The cost or pricing of such dinners is relative to what we serve. It is a challenge to bring many ingredients into India and that challenge is augmented by a higher cost, hence the dinners can become expensive. Then again, the same is true for Sri Lanka, where the import duties are so high that if you want to use interesting ingredients from overseas, it ends up being very expensive. Until governments change policy on these matters, we as restaurateurs are helpless when it comes to controlling prices.”', 'While most of these pop ups sell out out quickly owing to the popularity of the chef and his/her cuisine, the real prize for hotels hosting them, is the cachet that comes from being associated with a celebrity chef. Testing waters by a restaurant, to get a perspective of where things could go, especially in case of a global cuisine, is yet another reason why such pop ups are held.', 'Meanwhile within the country, small pop ups by home cooks are gaining momentum as well.

For director Mahesh Upputuri though, who’s coming up with the film\nSnehamera Jeevitham\nthis week, it was an opportunity to rekindle nostalgia. His earlier outings\nJagame Maaya\nand\nPaddanandi Premalo Mari\ntoo showcased his love for song titles. What gives\nSnehamera Jeevitham\n(as a title) more relevance is its 1982 setting. It was an opportunity that the director used to unleash great entertainment value with timely political, film and literary references in the Mandapeta Telugu dialect. “Songs are an apt way to summarise a theme of the film. I attribute it to my love for music, I grew up listening to songs of ANR, NTR,” the filmmaker says.', 'While Mahesh’s first film\nJagame Maya\ncouldn’t find a release, his next film, the Varun Sandesh-starrer\nPaddanandi Premalomari\nlost out to slew of releases on the same day. Though he earned kudos for the film’s technical values, his dialogues and its central theme, bad timing let him down. “The major change I’ve seen in myself as a filmmaker over these projects is my ability to translate what I’ve written on paper onto the celluloid. In the past, I relied on heavy-duty dialogues to do the job. I now understand how to communicate the core of my plot better. In\nSnehamera Jeevitham\n, you’ll see more visual metaphors,” he promises.', ""In a bid to lend authenticity to the film's 80s setting, he used props, the good-old ambassador cars, cycles, the trunk-call system, STD booths, references to politicians and actors besides advertisements as a few indicators. Given that he had a limited budget on hand, he couldn’t experiment beyond a certain point. As the film aims to be an ode to frendship, Mahesh weaved the plot with many personal references. The story reportedly throws light on a few communication gaps that destroys relationships.\nPrema Desam\nremains the director’s favourite film while dealing with this theme."", ""The lack of a big commercial star to nudge the film ahead doesn't bother him. Content-oriented films thriving in Telugu cinema now is proof that audience considers it more important than a big or a small hero, he says. Sivabalaji and Rajeev Kanakala are known more as actors over heroes, the lack of baggage came in handy for the director. “These are two stubborn, strong characters that every spectator would relate with. Even before I pitched the story to them, I looked at it as a character-oriented film that needed strong performances and not an aura surrounding them. They’ve taken forward the essence of the story beautifully,” Mahesh mentions that their off-screen camaraderie was an added advantage that reflected on-screen. That they were open-minded to understand, re-work and improvise on sets helped Mahesh’s cause."", ""Though many films deal with time-travel and two timeframes, not often do you see an entire film set in a single phase.

On November 14 and 15, ‘Props and Rocks’ — the annual Ikebana exhibition by children was hosted at Saptaparni, which amply displayed this unique talent in children. Organised by Rekha Reddy, president of Ikebana International Hyderabad, the exhibition was inaugurated by actor Rana Daggubati and showcased 32 exhibits. The exhibition is the outcome of a workshop conducted by Rekha Reddy prior to the show.', 'Every year the exhibition has a theme, this year the participants focused on Hyderabad and its tourism — to take inspiration from its different parts, sights and the culture of the city. The work put up at the exhibition was artistic and enlightening, each piece with a story of its own. They were composed of simplified natural elements used in Japanese culture, that transformed into scenic flower arrangements along with accesories to create a storyline. The formation was using exquisite flora with bold, bright colours that suited the other elements in accordance with the maker’s perspective.', 'The show depicted Hyderabad in its complete originality; some leaning towards its historic heritage, some featuring the great arena of sports with their respective sportspeople outsourced by the city and some simply beautifying its cultural destinations and festivities. Their creations took into consideration all the principles of art like rhythm, depth, harmony, balance and most importantly the structures spatial recognition. The different types of materials used resonate to the authenticity of Japanese elements such as flowers, stems, leaves, stones, wood and terracotta. They were arranged following the basic styles of Ikebana with all projects having a subject, object and filler. With the colour composition in sync with the theme, the work portrayed in these exhibits were within a specified dome for it to look balanced.', '“Ikebana is a subtle art form and it is of utmost importance to have a flow of space in the creations filled with floral material,” explains Rekha Reddy.', 'All the exhibits contributed a vision at different heights and angles and commemorated the city’s well kept extravagances with absolute distinction.']"
Hyderabad,"['Potent mixMost action sequences in books are either preceded or followed by a drink', 'I was introduced to the beautiful world of alcohol through books. My dad, an aficionado of dark rum, allowed me to read the popular books in his library when I was about 15. I loved those books — mostly crime and detective fiction — where every action, whether with the gun or after the characters had undressed, had to be preceded by a scene where alcohol was sampled, because alcohol is a plot-thickening tool.', 'Raymond Chandler famously said, “When in doubt, have a man come through a door with a gun in his hand.” I would like to rephrase: “When in doubt, have a man or a woman drink an extra few pegs.” Guns and alcohol, much like good women and bad men, were the sure-fire ingredients of all the engaging crime novels that I’d read.', 'One of my earliest influences was Ian Fleming: the suave James Bond usually had a drink in one hand — martini, shaken not stirred — and a hot girl in the other. As I reflect upon this today, perhaps because the act of drinking preceded that of making out, I was prompted to try drinking when I was just 16. There were other reasons too. My dad once asked me to take a sip of rum from his tumbler, and when I made a face at the awful taste, he asked me to take a bite from an omelette he was eating, before the next sip. That was a winning combination, and to date, on rare winter evenings when I long for rum, my mind turns to that omelette.', 'But blaming dad for my later years of fighting alcoholism would be diluting my own mistakes. An unlimited access to books and movies when I worked on ships later, were the real reasons that took me downhill, polluting in the process, my rational thinking. As I moved to the officer’s mess via the academy on completion of my training, alcohol continued to heighten the often mundane life, particularly the evenings. I tried cocktails that I had read about in books, learnt how to pair\ntandoori\nmeats and mess food with wines in place of mignon steaks that I had often read about, and learnt about the appropriate crystal ware. During my alcohol-fuelled years, I had several near breakdown moments. I fought depression, could barely focus on work, and had become that pessimistic guy whom everyone wanted to avoid. But I was lucky and my boat of sanity kept righting itself after every such ordeal. Besides a loving family, there was Hemingway, of course.', 'Ernest Hemingway might have been a bad influence on many, but not me. Let me elaborate. It’s no secret that alcohol was not just his lifeblood, but he had also extended the habit to the characters he wrote about. In\nA Farewell to Arms,\nfor\n\nexample\n,\nFrederic Henry loved his martinis. In the short story,\nThe\nThree-Day Blow\n, Nick Adams, nursing a breakup with his girlfriend, enjoys whiskey, chatting with his friend, Bill. As a young officer, I remember reading that Hemingway never drank when he worked. In fact, he was quoted as saying that he could spot those who drank and wrote, in no time. This tiny fact kept me on track for many years, as I had also been groomed not to mix work and alcohol, something that I’ve scrupulously stuck to even after quitting a life in uniform in 2014.', 'While still in the service, however, as I moved from one unit to the other, it took me some time to develop a taste for Philip Marlowe, the hard-drinking, chess-loving detective created by Raymond Chandler. The books led me to watching movie adaptations and the taste for hard-boiled crime stayed on. In fact, almost all the short stories that I have written thrive on a noir-ish essence that is integral to the storytelling.', 'Not blaming here, but the gods, as stated in our ancient texts, have also kept the lure for alcohol strong for us, and I’m no exception. The other day, dealing with a hangover, my friend remarked, “It’s\nsomras yaar\n, even the gods drank it.” When I asked him if there was anything written on how to deal with a hangover in our religious texts, he smiled and whispered, “Two options: either start praying, or drink some more.”', 'I had his attention when I said there was a third option too, “Find out in the books of yore about how the gods dealt with alcoholism and hangover.”', 'The protagonists in Kulpreet Yadav’s spy thrillers are tough-thinking, alcohol-drinking men.

Our server explained: ‘This is aezay, the traditional chilli paste’.', 'What makes it special is that it is made from a dried local chilli. It is about a span long and is bigger in circumference as well. Quite interested, we took half a teaspoon each to test its intensity.', 'It was fiery hot but aromatic and flavourful. By the end of the traditional meal, we had already devoured two dessert-sized bowls of aezay among my two friends and me. After that, the next six days of our stay in Thimphu, Punakha Valley and Paro, we ate bowls of aezay for lunch and dinner, and sometimes with our snacks as well.', 'In the process, we got to taste a wide range of this accompaniment. Every house and restaurant has its own style of the dish, which can be vegetarian and non-vegetarian alike. The chilli powder can be mixed with a wide range of ingredients, including fresh crumbled cow cheese, minced meat with fresh peppercorns or onions.', 'Some places mix the chilli powder with black pepper and freshly minced tomatoes to make a paste which is a perfect condiment to bland soups or the butter tea. In my search for aezay to bring back home, I stumbled upon readymade beef and dried shrimp aezay. During this search, we also came across something in a provision shop; to make things easy, the shop had a coarsely dried chilli powder of the Bhutia chilli. This is used by locals to prepare aezay at home.', 'The Bhutanese do not have a concept of dal or curry, but no meal is complete without aezay, informed our guide on a parting note.']"

Archaeologist and Founder-Curator of the Nevatim Museum in Israel that houses details, which preciously preserve her community’s enigmatic past, Tirza believes that the connection between Israel and India will never dim.', 'The Malabari Jews first set foot in India nearly 2,000 years ago. And the ancient seaport of Muziris, its neighbouring regions, was home to this community for generations, till Israel was formed in 1948. When the Jews left for the ‘Promised Land’ they took back with them memories of life here. Tirza is one such Jew.', '“I was born in Paravur as the seventh of nine children. We lived in a three-storied house built by my grandfather near the entrance to the town. Most of my community left before I was born. At that time, because of the dwindling numbers, members of the community in neighbouring Chendamangalam moved to Paravur. This was so because of the absence of a\nminyan\n(a quorum of 10 members needed for prayer at a synagogue) in their village,” says Tirza.', 'Later, Tirza too moved to Israel with her parents, at the age of 13. “It was like uprooting a tree and moving it to an unfamiliar surrounding. Everything was foreign, the language, culture, dress code and food.” In school, things were not easy, she says. She had to study Hebrew in depth and adapt to a completely new system. Tirza explains that it took a while to let go off ‘the sense of home’, which was Kerala. And even years after living in Israel, she says that there is an uncanny tug at her heart to reach out to Paravur.', 'Memories of her childhood are vivid — of Hebrew and Malayalam lessons, festivities at the synagogue, and prayers. Much of their life revolved around the Synagogue and its grounds where children played, to the celebration of Israel’s independence day. “In Israel, the older generation strongly hold on to these memories and tradition.”', ""She, however, is concerned about the new generation who has little connection to their Indian ancestry, except through stories narrated to them by their families. “It first began with my father's keen interest in our ancestry and then my MA study where I submitted two papers on the subject: One was on the immigration process of the Malabari Jews to Israel and the other was the absorption of the community and the second generation in Israel.” This sparked a keen love for the subject, and delving deeper into the details of it, she played a pivotal role in establishing a centre for Kerala Jews in Israel. “It began with an exhibition that was set up in 1984 to celebrate 30 years of immigration of the Jews from Kochi. The centre’s vision is to preserve and present the material and spiritual culture of the Jewish community of Kerala, and to serve as a cultural centre facilitating research.”"", 'The town of Paravur, where the community set foot 900 years ago (according to oral, local Jewish tradition), with its entrance columns, houses adorned with extensive backyards and wells, the grand Synagogue, and the echo of voices of the community elders in the town square, Tirza says remains today only in books and images at the small museum at the centre in Israel. The permanent exhibition reveals the atmosphere and life of the Jews in Kerala, before their migration, which includes rituals, weddings, celebration of Jewish holidays and so on. A film that narrates the customs and traditions of the Jews, including interviews with the elders of the community is also screened.', 'The oil lamps and other artefacts offer knowledge of the tangible heritage of the community in Kerala. “Nearly 5,000 visitors visit the place annually,” says Tirza, and every year they have a get together for the members of the community, where they relive memories of their past.', 'Currently, Tirza is working on contributing to a book on Cochinni Jews. A collection of articles from various people of the community in Israel will be released shortly to add more information on the Malabari Jews in Israel. “We work to gather as much as information of the community as possible, memoirs, artefacts...everything that tells of our heritage.” Now, Tirza is looking forward to working on a project during the next Kochi-Muziris Biennale through a local collaboration.']"

He was not a big fan of imported gourmet food. “Food tastes best when it doesn’t sit in the freezer for long, meets the standards of steady temperature, right ingredients and proper transportation. So I decided to learn the art of ice cream making. I did a course in ice cream making in US.”', 'After that, all he wanted was a skilled team, the machinery and the place.

I got to know Shyama because of the book I had written on Shammi Kapoor titled\nShammi Kapoor: The game changer\n.”', 'It was during this period that Ahmed chanced upon a meeting with the veteran star, “Shammi actually told me that his film\nThokar\n(1953), starring Shyama was his first film that actually did well. He described her as a vivacious person. So I got in touch with her, but she, on the other hand, was terrified of Shammi Kapoor.” The revelation was as innocuous as it was humorous, he says, “She narrated an incident [about] a romantic scene Shammi grabbed her and squeezed her. He was so aggressive, she literally went breathless. Two days later she was offered another film opposite Shammi, but turned that down.”', 'Sounding amused Ahmed continued the story with a chuckle, “Shammi got to know of it through his producer and turned up at her house the following day. But Shyama sheepishly excused herself, blaming her health and breathlessness as the reason. She did specify that his intentions were good and that he was great fun to work with. She joked about how terrified she was with his physical onslaught, but did end up signing the next one after that.”', 'Shyama joined films when she was around 14 and rose to fame in Bollywood swiftly, winning accolades and critical acclaim.

Most of the times when we are talking about poems, we are talking about a transcendence, a leap. I wanted to coalesce the leap with the physical uplift of poems in physical forms.”', 'Fascinating experience', 'He calls the experience of translating\nBeyond Images\na fascinating one. “It was amazing from the first poem to last. Mona has captured her feelings through various stages of her life through poems. This book starts with nostalgia and has a metaphor when she says ‘Memories are broken toys with which all adults play’. It is basically nostalgia which is carried from the first to last.”', 'Rhymes were a challenge, “If you talk about the form, I had to concentrate on the correctness of translation which was a major challenge.

Kochi,"['It’s 8 pm in Goa and it’s quite likely that the verandah of an old Goan house will be chock full of people. One may wonder on seeing it. But the smell of fresh baked Goan bread that wafts in the air will make you realise that this tiny house is actually a bakery and these people are gathered to get their daily bread.', 'Usually baked fresh twice a day (in the mornings and evenings), this bread is sold by the ‘poder’ on his bicycle. In fact, it isn’t uncommon to spot him cycle down residential localities with a big cane basket full of bread covered with tarpaulin to protect the ware from heat, dust and rains. For many Goans, the poder’s early morning cycle bell is a wake-up call of sorts. Priced at a modest Rs. 3 to Rs. 5, this bread is as quintessentially Goan as are its robust balchaos and cafreals.', 'Steeped in history', 'You may wonder, what’s so special about this Goan bread? Well, everything. Right from the way it is made, baked, and variety to the fact that it is also steeped in history.', 'It is believed that the Portuguese Jesuit priests taught the Goans how to bake bread. The hard-working Goans learnt the art quickly enough and the Goan\npao\nwas born. The word\npao\nis a Portuguese term for bread. But, some believe that it is a quarter of a loaf and that’s why it is known as\npao\n. A standing joke is that the poders would knead the dough with their legs and thus the name\npao\n(Hindi word for legs).', 'What’s in a shape', 'This bread comes in a variety of shapes and sizes. The most common one is the\npoiee\n(made from wheat flour and husk), which resembles a pita;\npao\n(soft variety);\nunndo\n(this has a hard crust and slit in between);\nkatro pao\n(soft bread shaped like a butterfly) and\nkakon\n(a circular bangle-shaped hard bread which is typically dipped in hot tea).', 'Each bread is paired with specific dishes. For example, dishes with a coconut gravy, such as chicken xacuti and mixed vegetable gravy, are eaten with either\npao\n,\npoiee\nor\nunndo\n. The other items like the\nchorusa pao\n,\nkanda bhaji/kapa\n(onion and potato pakoras),\nrass\nomelet with\npao\nare hot favourites for evening snacks. However, the ideal way to eat these breads is to toast them with butter and top with a sprinkling of sugar; a perfect snack.', 'In Goa, you will find the traditional bakeries not only in villages but also in towns and cities. According to All Goa Bakers Association, there are 300 registered bakers, but the unofficial number could be around 1,000. Their dark, dusty interiors are hot and humid, and you will come across bakers who do nothing but bake bread day and night. Typically, a bakery sells around 1,500 to 2,500 pieces of bread a day.', 'They start the process by pre-heating the oven, which takes a few hours. The dough is made from\nmaida\n, yeast, sugar and water. Completely handmade, there are no preservatives involved, and it is baked in a traditional wood-fired oven; a dome-like structure made from mud and bricks. For heat, firewood and coconut husk are traditionally used.', 'The tipsy baker', 'Researcher and writer, Maria de Lourdes Bravo da Costa Rodrigues, mentions that the basic technique of making bread is the same, except for one ingredient, which is toddy. “Earlier, as yeast was not available, bakers used toddy for fermentation. Toddy made the bread more flavourful and tasty.”', 'But these days, palm toddy is not as easily available, as there are hardly any toddy tappers left in Goa. But venture into some of the South Goa villages and you might just stumble across a baker still using toddy to bake bread.', 'In the village of Velsao in South Goa, the bakery owned by Pedro Anton Fernandes is probably one of the few remaining ones where toddy is used to ferment the dough. Sheras Fernandes, a regular customer here, says, “Adding toddy to the dough not only makes it tastier, but also increases the shelf life of the bread. It stays fresh for more than two days.”', 'In fact, so celebrated is\npao\nin Goa that there’s an annual Poderachem Fest or Bakers Festival that is held in the village of Succour in North Goa. It is the time when bread lovers and bakers come together to help keep this baking tradition alive.', '', 'The word\npao\nis a Portuguese term for bread. But, some believe that it is a quarter of a loaf and that’s why it is known as\npao', '', 'Wood’s the trick', 'It is believed that wood-fired ovens boost the flavour of food. There is a significant difference in taste in food cooked in a wood-fired oven and an electric one. This is largely due to the even distribution of heat and the unique smoky flavour the food imbibes from the burning of wood.']"

Continental food was what Britannia & Co was synonymous with, ever since it was started by Boman’s father, Rashid, in 1923. “The British naturally did not want spicy food, so we catered to their palates,” says Boman.', 'It was only after Independence that some Mughlai fare was made part of the menu, as they did not feel the need to serve Continental food only. After retirement, Boman’s wife took an active interest in the restaurant and infused her Parsi touch into the menu. Her personal recipes were shared with the chefs and are followed till date. Berry\npulao\n, chicken\ndhansak\n,\nsali boti\n, fish\npatra\nand caramel custard became a part of the offerings here and are still the fastest selling items.', '“Gradually, once the British left, we did away with the Continental dishes and included spicy Parsi and Mughlai dishes for our diners,” Boman quips.', 'Tweaking a legacy', 'He further reminisces, “In those days, berry\npulao\nwas made of soft fluffy rice, tender meat or chicken and imported Irani zereshk berries. It was priced at a measly Rs. 45 a plate. My wife tweaked the recipe she had sampled when posted in Tehran and created her own version, which soon became the high point of our restaurant. Owing to inflation, the price of mutton berry\npulao\nis Rs. 750 a plate today.”', 'Like many other Zoroastrian immigrants from Iran, Rashid Kohinoor came to Bombay and decided to get into the restaurant business. His son Boman has been involved in the running of Britannia since he was 16 years old, as he had to step in when his father died in 1939 in an accident. Although Boman still comes daily to the restaurant, his son Afshin looks into the running of the restaurant. Boman is happy taking orders, talking to his guests and regaling them with colourful old stories.', 'He revels in the nostalgia and accolades Britannia has received over the years. On a wall, cultural tributes, which Boman is immensely proud of, preside. A painting of Queen Elizabeth II is next to a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi, both hanging beneath a gilt-framed picture of Zarathustra, the Zoroastrian prophet worshipped by the Parsis. He further shows off to his guests the letter he has received from Her Majesty’s office. These are his priceless treasures.', 'Dreams come true', 'The highlight of his life, he feels, was when his dream to meet Prince William and Kate, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, came true and he actually got a chance to see them.', 'Making money has never been Boman’s mantra. Small wonder then that the restaurant opens daily for four hours only, for dinner on Saturdays and remains closed on Sundays.', 'The Bentwood furniture imported by his father is still a part of the restaurant, but Boman confesses, “This place was very sophisticated and posh back then. Now it is simple and ordinary.”', 'Content with his limited menu offerings, Boman does not feel the need to make additions. “Guests come here for their favourite dishes; so why complicate matters by introducing more. Let us continue to serve these well,” he states, matter-of-factly.', 'No compromises', 'Their food may appear more expensive than some other Irani cafés, but Boman emphasises they use only fresh, good quality ingredients and never compromise on anything. Competition has never bothered him, as he is confident of his food and knows he has a loyal clientèle. “We have people coming from abroad regularly to dine here and some even carry back our food,” he says proudly. He adds, “An air hostess flying to London used to carry 100\nchapatis\nwith her as she loved the soft, fluffy\nchapatis\nwe make.”', 'The fame that Britannia enjoys in Mumbai and even in other parts of the country and world is what he holds dear. “Patrons come here from all over the globe, and after eating our food, write about it in the media. That is how we have gained word-of-mouth publicity. Else we have never advertised,” he declares with pride.', 'One of the last Irani restaurants in Mumbai, Boman has given almost 80 years of his life to this place and wants it to continue forever. “I want the family legacy to continue, that’s all,” he says. He is hopeful his grandson Daanish, who is still quite young, will step in, but is realistic too. “It is not possible for one person to manage Britannia. Let’s see what happens after me,” he signs off.', 'In this weekly column, we take a peek at some of the country’s most iconic restaurants', '', 'Their food may appear more expensive than some other Irani cafés, but Boman emphasises they use only fresh good quality ingredients and never compromise on anything', '', 'Did you know?', 'Known as pilaf, paella and pulao, the rice dish has conquered the world with its interesting flavour and multitude of variations.

Silhouettes have been kept effortless, with comfort being the utmost focus.', 'Should we make children conscious of clothes, and at what age?', '', ""Shivan:\nWith social media being at the centre of everything we do today, it is virtually impossible to limit their exposure to fashion and trends. However, kids don't need to be made conscious of brands at an early age. Children should be encouraged to express themselves via their clothes, but the brands they wear shouldn't necessarily be at the forefront."", 'Is kidswear an international phenomenon?', '', 'Narresh:\nVery much so. For years now, celebrity children have been scrutinised for their outfits, which has resulted isn them being decked out in the finest clothes that are on offer in the market. Luxury brands have tapped into this demand, and this phenomenon has trickled down to India as well.', 'Is there a specialisation required in kidswear?', '', ""Shivan:\nThe kidswear category has gained popularity with an unmatched momentum, and has long surpassed women’s wear and men’s wear.

I got to know Shyama because of the book I had written on Shammi Kapoor titled\nShammi Kapoor: The game changer\n.”', 'It was during this period that Ahmed chanced upon a meeting with the veteran star, “Shammi actually told me that his film\nThokar\n(1953), starring Shyama was his first film that actually did well. He described her as a vivacious person. So I got in touch with her, but she, on the other hand, was terrified of Shammi Kapoor.” The revelation was as innocuous as it was humorous, he says, “She narrated an incident [about] a romantic scene Shammi grabbed her and squeezed her. He was so aggressive, she literally went breathless. Two days later she was offered another film opposite Shammi, but turned that down.”', 'Sounding amused Ahmed continued the story with a chuckle, “Shammi got to know of it through his producer and turned up at her house the following day. But Shyama sheepishly excused herself, blaming her health and breathlessness as the reason. She did specify that his intentions were good and that he was great fun to work with. She joked about how terrified she was with his physical onslaught, but did end up signing the next one after that.”', 'Shyama joined films when she was around 14 and rose to fame in Bollywood swiftly, winning accolades and critical acclaim. Her career spanned 40 years with over 175 Bollywood films to her credit. She was at the peak of her career in the 1950s and 60s, her claim to fame being the Guru Dutt classic\nAar Paar\n(1954). The list of her films also includes\nMilan\n\n(1967\n), Sawan Bhadon\n(1970) andSharada(1957) (also starring Raj Kapoor and Meena Kumari) for which she won the\nFilmfare\naward for the best supporting actress.', 'Ahmed reveals, “One of her earliest films was when she was all of 14 or 15. It was a film called\nZeenat\n(1945) where Noor Jahan was the heroine and it had a famous\nqawwali\nwhich got her immediately noticed. Her marriage to Fali Mistry also helped her move around Bollywood circles.”', 'Despite being so prolific, Shyama didn’t quite attain the status of other actors in her time. Ahmed says, “She was a popular person in the industry mid-50s onward. She was stylish in that sense, had a great figure and danced very well. Histrionically she was very good, but at the same time, she didn’t have the heroine qualities like her contemporaries Waheeda Rehman and Madhubala. It was all a matter of luck she told me.”', '']"

The rural participation rate for women in India is 30% as compared to 15% in the urban sector and even in services, the ratio is about 20%. This statistics get even more shocking when you consider India is on the path to urbanisation,” he said, delivering the key note address at ‘Best of the Best Conference in Chennai. The conference was organised by U.S.-based Working Mother and Chennai-based AVTAR Group, which also identified 100 best companies for women in India.', 'Mr. Mehra also noted that today, in universities, 42% of graduates coming out of science and technology are actually women, yet the gender participation rates in urban India are very low.', 'He noted that the equation has to change fast and diversity has proven to be good for business as it brings tangible benefits for an organisation as well as society. Mr. Mehra also said that estimates suggest that India’s GDP can be boosted by an additional 1% if more women are brought into the workforce. He pointed out that according to the World Economic Forum, it would take 217 years to bridge the gender gap.', 'Mr. Mehra added that some progressive companies are taking efforts to improve gender diversity by putting in place policies. For instance, in the IT/BPM industry, the participation of women has grown 1.8 times since 2009 to 34%, he added. At HSBC, he claimed, there are 30,000 employees at its global delivery centres in India and women’s participation is about 40% overall and 20% at the senior level.', 'Mr. Mehra also suggested that the mandatory 2% of profits of companies to be spend on corporate social responsibility should go towards gender uplift and women’s education.', 'Delivering the welcome address, Subha Barry, senior vice-president and managing director, Working Mother Media, said she is looking to developing a Diversity Best Practices (DBP) Inclusion Index, and customised studies to India in partnership with AVTAR.

The world today is divided between those who walk around with hundreds of books and magazines on an e-reader, and those who still prefer to hold them by their spine. But the count of the latter is on the wane. Remember the fate of the once-popular magazines like\nCleo, MacWorld, Gourmet\nand\nVibe\n? All hope’s not lost though — luxury magazine,\nVogue\n, brought out its 100th print edition last year. Following in the footsteps of the West, a growing tribe of print warriors in India are fighting to sustain the print magazine, the definition of which has evolved over time. It’s less rigid in terms of genre and more focussed, and even has a cooler version — the zine. “If anyone has a hot topic and wants to get it out to the readers in a short, quick format, one can do so with a snappy new zine,” says Nupur Joshi, founder of Paper Planes, a magazine subscription portal. Like\nOh Nari, So Sanskari\n— a zine by young designer Annushka Hardikar, which took on society, traditions and our myths — or the latest edition of\nShowroom\n, which showcased vignettes of life, with ‘Some days’ as the theme. Bombay Underground, the pioneers of zine culture in the country, is also coming out with one on Amy Winehouse — with contributions from people who love her work — and another exclusively on cats! There are no restrictions to what you can publish in a zine, really. Here we bring you the three zines to follow, and the people behind them.', '', 'This is a magazine that already knows what the end will be like. Ten bi-annual issues and that’s it, confirms Shreya Dalmia. The fashion graduate from the London School of Fashion (with a specialisation in publishing) conceptualised it in her final year — a zine that would represent the modern side of India through bold visuals. “I wanted to build a crossover product, where both sides could feed off from,” says Dalmia, who launched the first issue of\nCurry\n(“called so, because it is the most popular Indian takeaway in London”) in February this year.', 'Flip through the 160-page zine, called\nTaste\n, and the topics — addressed by writers and artists from India and Europe — are what many conventional publications would keep a safe distance from. “We talk about homosexuality, we publish nude images... hard hitting content that is usually censored. But in the age of internet, censorship is a big farce. If you convey information in the right way, it becomes okay,” she shares, adding, “We also talk about religion, economics, politics and other sensitive issues through stellar designs. Someone has to speak about it, and art is a medium that we could use when no other freedom is allowed.” Working out of a small studio space in Kolkata, she, along with her team of two interns, is readying the next,\nComing of Age\n, a pack of five zines (to be launched by the end of the year) with contributors from Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Nepal, and so on. The brand Curry also holds zine-making workshops and sells merchandise. “Currently, we retail out of around 10 stores, three in Kolkata and the rest across cities such as Kochi, Jaipur, Delhi, Mumbai and Himachal Pradesh. You can also place a request online,” she signs off. Details: currymagazine.live', '', 'An annual from the popular Gaysi family, the zine is five issues old and is still being brought out by a team of two: Priya Gangwani, editor, and Sakshi, the founder, who manages “everything else”. It is a tangent of the online blog the organisation runs because, as Gangwani puts it, “We thought we needed it to give permanence to some stories and articles.', 'From a small print booklet — “brought out with our pocket money” — to 130 pages thick, the zine has evolved both in size and content. “The first three issues were generic, mostly revolving around what it means to be queer in India, and pushing the boundaries of sexuality and gender definition.” More recently, for issue four, Gaysi collaborated with 28 artists across the country, and explored the concept of storytelling using graphic narratives. The latest was based on the theme of ‘desire’. “Desire is the very crux of divide between the straight and queer community. The issue explores the realm of queer desires, not from the perspective of sex and sexuality, but more from the politics of desire,” says Gangwani, who crowdfunds every issue, explaining that it “allows us to also collaborate with the community”.', 'The issues cover everything from fiction, poetry, erotica and interviews, to activism and politics, and has featured writers such as Parvati Sharma, Roselyn D’Mello, artist Balbir Krishan and the popular women’s collective, Kadak. They also organise movie screenings, social club nights and open mic talks, where “we talk about things that are considered taboo. It’s a bridge between straight and queer folks in Mumbai. Artists such as AIB and East India Comedy have also shown support,” she says.

Besides “consistently setting up reading spaces, with alternate material”, they organised the first ever Zine Festival in Mumbai earlier this year, and are now planning to take it across six cities. Many of their zines, such as\nEveryone is an Artist\nand\nStop Making Friends\n, are self published. The duo believes that “independent publishing is their response to the fact that most publishing houses and bookstores are either ignorant of radical literature and zines, or deliberately exclude such materials”.', 'One of their popular ones is\nA5\n, which addresses a wide variety of topics such as gender, caste, cross culture, feminism and patriarchy, over the course of 24 issues. “Sometimes, we put out an open call to people contributing on various topics. Our 17th issue had 14 contributors, ranging from college students to professional photographers, to movie directors and more,” says Himanshu, who is also trying to reopen discourses that evoke a grassroot change (that once used to be the prerogative of small-scale printing presses, which are now fast shutting down). “Some of our zines also come from our neighbourhood projects in Dharavi. These contain a plethora of subjects — from rethinking girlhood and dismantling it, to documenting Dharavi from the perspective of the women there,” Thami adds.', 'Though funding is a constant worry, they are now working towards establishing a zine library.

It was a win-win situation, since we had been hand-holding him almost since he began,” she says, explaining the sponsorship continued even during a cost-cutting exercise, thanks to the contract. Chopra went on to become a Grandmaster at the age of 14.', 'Similarly, Shrimant Jha, paralympic arm wrestling champion, is supported by JSPL, and employed at its Raipur plant. “We not only support him with the costs of his sport, but also ensure he gets a regular source of livelihood,” she explains.

When the budgets of plant locations are squeezed, how long can the owner lead his philanthropic vision through a company made up of 15,000 employees? Essentially, instead of CSR, I emphasised on ‘social commitment’, which is incentive driven.', 'Another example is our work in making female contraceptives available. A problem area was flimsy machines. JSPL partnered with Hindustan Latex Family Planning and Parenthood, the largest condom distributor in India, to make sturdy steel vending machines.', 'It was a commercial transaction at cost price, not CSR.

Companies in other countries take compliance very seriously, but here, despite progressive laws, implementation is not very strong.', 'But the private sector is a great platform to create large scale social impact if you can convince big businesses to be social entrepreneurs. At 29, I took a call to switch from a successful career in managing hedge funds in Paris to do everything I love doing. I started writing again. I started an NGO, Stargazers, in India. The following year, I joined the World Economic Forum in Geneva to manage West Asia and South Asia regions for Young Global Leaders. Eventually, I wanted a huge platform to be able to make an impact, and the private sector provided me that.', 'How has this stint helped in Sustain Labs Paris?', 'I bring my experiences from across the world to a country I feel strongly about. Though I will look at other countries, the focus will be on India. The need of the hour is exchange of solutions across geographies, and we will enable that. It helps that Indians are feeling the effect of being non-sustainable and want to make the switch.', 'You are against sustainability being limited to CSR alone.', 'That’s right. It should grow organically and become part of the company ethos. It should come into play when you’re planning production, a new plant, anything… Usually, there’s a constant tussle between the production and environment teams.', 'Once they become part of the process, the environment angle will become part of budgeting.', 'What does sustainability truly mean?', 'It means a holistic field that takes care of everything, from human capital to natural resources. It might mean different things to different people; a start-up might look at financial sustainability; another company might look at a new area. We truly achieve sustainability when everyone feels he/she has a stake in what’s happening. Ask for suggestions. Implement them. Make people feel they are part of the change. The idea is to see where companies are, analyse where they can go and help them get there through conversations, town hall meetings. I speak of interim hand holding, but being independent in the longterm. So, we gradually identify what’s needed and put in place the capacity to get there.', 'You began work on the incubator a few months ago. How has it turned out?', 'It’s been up since March 2017, and will take on board four ‘incubatee’ organisations a year. So far, two large infrastructure companies and one academic institution have come on board for 2018.

Chennai,"['Delhi’s ‘luxury mall’ came alive last month to the DLF Emporio Couture Wedding, with a preview show and curated stylist sessions with handpicked clients. Tanya Ghavri, stylist to the stars and the person behind Dhoom Dham, a wedding trunk show held in Mumbai last year, helped young women and their families with the sometimes-overwhelming shopping experience. Then, she broke it down for us too.', 'Understand what you want.\nStart with what colour you want and then go on to the style. Ghavri has just been with a to-be bride who has shortlisted an Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla multi-colouredlehengawith a hot pink blouse and midnight-bluedupatta, and a Surekha Jain outfit in similar hues. Ask yourself what kind of person you are, what kind of wedding you’d like (formal/informal), what the location is (garden/beach/hotel), and how warm it’ll be. Put these together and include anyone else’s take you want on it. Ghavri sees brides choosing contemporary pastels (lavender, pista) and threadwork rather thangota-pattior stones, in light fabrics (net, georgette, chanderi).', '“Designers are using work tactfully. Anamika Khanna does threadwork on the whole\nlehenga\n, while Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla will always have something inchikankari.”', 'Many brides are also choosing single can-cans, to sustain themselves through the night. “It’s all personal preference, really — if you feel like this is your moment and you want to stand out, then you may be alright with feeling slightly uncomfortable, just as long as the pictures look great!” says Ghavri.', 'Write it down.\nIf you’re unsure of what you want, you may know what you don’t want. “My sister was clear she did not want red, so she chose a blue ombre outfit, with a cape, going from sky to dark. The cape was convenient and had the effect of adupatta,” says Ghavri. Avoid short-listing more than five or six designers, or you may have a problem choosing.', 'Keeping a list also helps you focus on the various occasions and what you’re looking at for each. Hold the piece in front of you and ask the store if you can take a picture (some stores don’t allow it). Ideally, you should be done with about three visits: a recce, a shortlist and the final purchase.', 'Freeze on numbers.\nMake that budget sheet and then look at what your main events are – most brides lock down on five outfits. “Some people like wearing a sari for the main ceremony, which may be traditional or restored or even a modern take, like the stitched ones Gaurav Gupta does. For the cocktail party, people like to go abroad and buy from Alexander McQueen, Jenny Packham, Stella McCartney. Elie Saab is very popular as are the Lebanese designers Zuhair Murad and Ziad Nakad,” she says.', 'For a brunch, you may consider focussing on a statement piece of jewellery, such as an heirloom or the ones from Suhani Pittie, Eina Ahluwalia or Outhouse, with a Payal Khandwala outfit or a simple jumpsuit, for instance. “Young\ndesi\ndesigners are doing a lot of colour-blocking – say a drape skirt or pants in red and a cape jacket in blue.”', 'Take along a trusted person.\nSomeone who will tell you what looks good and what doesn’t, someone who can point out whether long sleeves or three-quarter looks better. Also someone who may give you a few ideas if you don’t have access to a stylist: like wearing a\nkamarbund\nover a sari and teaming temple jewellery with a contemporary Raw Mango sari.', '“I always advise brides to have open necks and show off collar bones, or their waists,” says Ghavri, drawing attention to fit-and-flare styles that do just that.', 'Celebrity stylist services start at Rs. 2 lakh for an event and include garment selection, discussions with the designer and store visits', '', 'Delhi and the north like bright colours – reds, oranges, pinks, yellows. They’ll also do wines and midnight blues for a sangeet. Mumbai is open to ivory, pastels, rust, dull gold, copper.

Chennai,"['“It’s been a sad day for goats,” William Dalrymple says, when I meet him ahead of his performance with singer Vidya Shah at the launch of\nThe Hindu\nNovember Fest last week. His Instagram account describes him as goatherd and\nkabooter baz\n, and in interviews, he is frequently pictured caressing all manner of caprinae. Gilbert, once king of Dalrymple’s flock, was displaced by his son Freud (horn envy seems an inevitable consequence with a name like that) — an event that put him in such despair, he had to be put down. “It’s interesting goats get depressed just like people do. They put their heads against the wall and don’t want to go on. It happened to Gilbert’s mother, Georgina, too. She had a still birth and it undid her, she just sat looking at the ground and died within a month.”', 'Stories about the last king are Dalrymple’s staple, but he tells me his next book will be a shift in gears. It will still feature a king, the Persian emperor Nader Shah, but it is really about a 60-year period in history when the wealthiest empire in the world is taken over by a boardroom of London merchants, giving rise to the East India Company. “It’s almost the first company in the whole world. From the Medicis in 15th century Florence, to a bunch of Sindhi merchants sitting on the coast of Porbandar in Kutch, businesses had always been family affairs. But to raise the capital necessary to trade at the other end of the world in the 16th century, the British invent the corporation, they have joint stock, and that changes the world more than anything else — more than Christianity, more than democracy. It has a universal take-up,” he says.', 'Rise of the corporation', 'The book, which may or may not be called\nThe Anarchy\n, will be Dalrymple’s most ambitious yet. “I’ve never done anything like it before,” he says. “All my books so far have been micro-studies of just two or three years, and they disguise their micro-ness in the great shaggy covering that makes it look like they’re about huge subjects.\nWhite Mughals\nis actually just a few years in Hyderabad,\nThe Last Mughal\nis two years in Delhi.” This one will cover 60 years, from the time Shah messes up the Mughal Empire, to 1803, when the British replace it, effectively by taking over Delhi, keeping the king as pensioner. “It’s a huge sweep of territory, people coming and going, playing lots of parts, all of which is very bad for the narrative. It’s like Chinese cooking for me.” Not a word has been written yet, which is normal, Dalrymple says. “The big history books take three to four years to research. I’m nowhere near the end.”', 'The Scottish historian and writer talks in great bursts of energy, frequently gesticulating with his arms. “It’s the most extraordinary bit of history,” he tells me. “When (the battle of) Plassey takes place, there’s only about 35 people working in that office, and yet this boardroom, this corporation, replaces the greatest and richest empire that India has ever seen… By 1802, the company has twice as many troops as the British army, and have the Mughal emperor in their back pocket. The weirdness is that Victorians rewrote history to make it look like a nationalist enterprise. Half of the book is not about the company versus India or the Mughals, it’s about the company against the British government — a struggle which goes on today in every legislature between lobbying groups who represent corporate interests.”', 'In continuity', 'The historical leap from 1803 to Donald Trump’s government, with its complicated ties to Russian business interests, is something that clearly excites Dalrymple. “The book is more topical than ever because this is the ultimate corporate takeover. Ditto with Modi’s India. It was the corporates who brought Modi to power with their massive ad campaigns and all the unquantifiable sums of money that went into the BJP for the last election. So this battle between the power of the state and the power of the corporation is the big story of our time, and the jury is out on who’s going to win,” he says.', 'Of course, as all historians know, the more things change, the more they stay the same. When I ask about historical continuity in India, he tells me the reason so much in the country stays the same amidst change is because of the way families are locked in. “When I was doing\nNine Lives\n, coming down here to write about Chola bronze makers — who are still sitting in a bend in the Cauvery, where they were plonked by Raja Raja Chola in 1100 — the same families are there making the same idols on the same bend in the Cauvery. No one has moved. It’s gone father to son for 37 generations since 1100.”', 'Continued on page 3', 'Continued from page 1', '', 'He’s quick to concede that this continuity can have negative influences; if you’re a sweeper for instance, it traps you into centuries of deprivation. But it can also offer important insights. “So when (art critic and historian) BN Goswamy was trying to write the history of (painter) Nainsukh, to find the history behind these amazing paintings, he just goes to the pilgrimage centre in Haridwar and looks up the family pilgrimage records and there they are in one volume. Father to son. Father to son. Every name of every painter in one single book.”', 'Keeping the optimism', 'But isn’t it also true, that for all this continuity, there are always multiple versions to the same story, and sometimes all this multiplicity can get confusing?', '“I remember writing\nHoly Mountain\nand thinking at the end of five years that I’ve seen the whole of the Middle East, all the major sights, been everywhere, talked to everyone. It’s a ridiculously arrogant thing to say, but I felt I understood it in a way I’ve never even begun to understand India,” he says, adding, “I’ve been running around this coastline for 30 years, but tomorrow I hope to see Fort St David (in Cuddalore), a major sight I’ve never seen before. It’s just endless!”', 'So, yes, history repeats itself, and yes we continue to ignore its lessons — but forget about looking backwards for a moment and give us a glimpse of the near future in this country. What do you see? I ask. “I’m not an admirer of this government,” Dalrymple states, “It’s Mussolini without the trains running on time. In the long term though, I’m a huge optimist for India. There are a million things that could go wrong, but everything I’ve read about its past has shown that India’s natural place is at the top of the top table, and, along with China, it should be the centre of the world again. Other than this period between 1498, when Vasco de Gama arrives, and 1947, when European gunboats and globalism put it into second rank for three to four hundred years, it’s been at the top. Pliny complained about all that Roman gold going East, and I think it will do so again. We’d really have to screw up in this country for that not to be the case within my lifetime.”', '', 'From the Medics in Florence, to a bunch of Sindhi merchants or Gujaratis sitting on the coast of Porbandar in Kutch, businesses had always been family affairs.

But the Internet giant hadn’t forgotten the occasion; instead, they announced the third edition of the Web Rangers contest that’s aimed at keeping teenagers safe online. And perhaps they have it right; if children aren’t vulnerable enough when they’re out in the world, a greater threat to their safety lives right at their fingertips.', 'A few months ago, the Blue Whale Challenge was the topic of discussion. But it’s only one of the many challenges online; there are other acts of self-harm disguised as ‘fun’ things to try out — eating a ghost pepper or swallowing a spoonful of cinnamon — which sometimes result in death. It’s not easy to understand how impressionable young minds come across this content, let alone indulge in them.', 'Finding solutions', 'Do the advent of these apps and the increasingly predatory atmosphere that our children are growing up in mean that it is time to pluck the gadget\ndu jour\nfrom their hands? Given the benefits that smartphones and tablets have, removing them altogether seems drastic. Just think of the tantrums that will follow! Instead, parents can fight fire with fire — to their benefit, in this case — and actively use parental control apps.

They have to be, considering the modern kindergärtner is more comfortable swiping screens than you and I ever will be.', 'Apps like Qustodio, Kidlogger, Zoodles, Kidtrol and Spyzie are available for free on Android and iOS platforms (because who uses an actual computer any more). Anti-virus software creators like Norton, McAfee and Kaspersky also have parental control apps and software.', 'Closer home, Noopur Raghunath came up with the idea for eKavach in early 2013, after being part of a conversation about cyber-security and children at a social gathering. “Being a parent myself, I observe and understand how the challenges in parenting are evolving,” she says.

Saurin Parikh, father of a seven-year-old, uses pattern locks on apps, has a visible screen policy, where he makes sure that his child uses his device only in front of parents. Bengaluru-based parenting blogger, Shailaja V, has a similar rule where her 11-year-old daughter can use her parents’ laptop for school work only under adult supervision and in a family room. She also uses an app called Kids Place that locks apps and restricts internet access on devices.

She also uses the NetNanny app and the Norton Family Control app.', 'But all three parents fervently agree that their responsibility doesn’t stop with just installing a few apps. “Matching the ingenuity and curiosity of children is always a challenge.

They engaged the children in a discussion about the aftermath of the completed “challenge” and it gave the parent and child some much-needed insight into each others worlds. “We need to acknowledge and respect their own levels of intelligence when we share our perspectives as adults,” says Naik.', 'Parents have to tread the fine line between policing screen time and being approachable to conversation about what happens online, says Mandiram. She explains, “A controlling attitude won’t work here, neither will underhanded ways like peeping into their devices. Kids need privacy as well, especially as emotionally vulnerable adolescents. Set practical boundaries, like no devices for an hour before bedtime. And avoid the advisory tone when talking to them about their social media lives. Engage them in conversation and build the trust that they can come to you with any problems.”', 'Young children can benefit from technology in marvellous ways, and these parental control apps are helpful when it comes to ensuring basic safety while reining in internet usage.

I only had an audience that sat in front of me back then. It always surprises me that there is an audience out there — that people watch you and know who you are. It’s a constant revelation to me,” he laughs.', 'Continuing in his deep baritone, the 69-year-old adds, “It seems everybody has seen\nGoT\n. I’m an actor for 47 years and then I am in this show, which is what people associate me with best.” The veteran reveals how this was brought home to him recently, at a stone merchant’s shop: “I needed a particular quantity of block stones to line a driveway and they could only give me a set amount, which was either too less or too much. So I asked, ‘Not even for Randyll Tarly?’ And this guy goes, in French, ‘My God, it is Randyll from\nGame of Thrones\n!’ And he agreed!”', 'When he’s not on stage, he’s a private person. “I don’t think about what I do for a living.

She’s a female James Bond and I’m her ‘M’ in the movie. I’ve also just finished a film for Sony called\nPaul: Apostle of Christ\n, in which I’m playing the lead,” he explains.', 'The defining part of his acting, he says, is that for the last 30 years he’s been playing the villain. “Once the first blush of youth had gone from my face, I’ve played the bad guy,” he laughs. “My agent says I’ve only got five more people to kill in my career! One of the things I do bring to the screen, I hope, is authority and intelligence.” So what does he want people to take-away from his performances? “I want my audience to be told a story. I don’t want them to be aware of who I am, I want them to be aware only of the character I play. If they believe in my character, I become real to them. That’s what I am — a pop-up character in a story book.”', 'Four decades later', 'Looking back at his acting journey, the actor believes he’s never had any control over his life. “I just ding from pillar to post.” But has the journey been exciting? “Not much back then. But things are exciting for me now. It is amazing that I’m still working and that I’m current,” he says.', 'Along the way, there are several memories he treasures. “\nUnderworld\nis memorable for the fact that, for the first time in my life, I got to play a vampire.

It’s a shame that he didn’t have a sense of humour.”', 'Speaking of his fondness for funny characters, he recalls, “I spent three years playing the Pope in a series called\nDa Vinci’s Demons\nand although he was not a real pope — he was a psychopath — he had a sense of humour. He enjoyed hoodwinking everyone.”', 'Playing Paul', 'However, his role in\nPaul: Apostle of Christ\n, was different. “This movie is in his last days in prison. Luke bribes his way in and persuades Paul to tell him his life story. That becomes the source for the Biblical book,\nActs of the Apostles\n. Paul, after Jesus, is the most important man in Christian history. It’s no accident that the biggest cathedral in London is named after him,” he says.', 'Faulkner admits, though, that it was a role that took him out of his centre and, hence, was frightening. “\nPaul\nwas frightening as I had very little time to prepare and many dialogues. So my wife broke it down for me. But playing such a beautifully written character was the best part. I didn’t have to do anything,” he says.

Then it all got replaced with Bollywood and cricket, and eventually so low became the denominator for people being featured on page 3 that they were simply termed socialites — a set of people whose only job was to be seen at social dos.

Chennai,"['Mainstream media has historically cried shy of portraying strong, self-reliant women on screen. No matter how robust their characters seem on the surface, further exploration always reveals a fundamental dependence on male peers in the storyline. But for actress Katheryn Winnick, portraying women in weighty roles is vital.', '“The medium of television and film has such a strong impact in building our society and influencing young girls and boys of cultural norms. I truly believe in the responsibility (to) depict women in powerful roles,” she says. In a chat with\nWeekend\n, she talks of how women are represented in media, her acclaimed role in the television history-drama,\nVikings,\nand her self-defence programme for women.', 'Beyond gender', 'According to Winnick, television shows and films with independent female characters are the need of the hour. “With all the Hollywood scandals of sexual harassment, I think it’s very important to have a strong role model and be able to show that (women) can fight for what they believe in,” she says. In fact, it isn’t just about the female demographic, the message needs to be universal, she insists.', 'In\nVikings\n, Winnick plays warrior queen Lagertha. “I feel it’s a character people look up to; she stands up for herself and sticks up for what she believes in,” she says, sharing that her personal belief — of equality for men and women — finds resonance in the character. “I feel like I bring a lot of my own personal life to the role, and I care very deeply about who she is and how she’s portrayed. What I love about playing Lagertha is that I’m constantly getting challenged,” she adds.', 'The Canadian-born actor, who won a Critics Choice Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for\nVikings\nin 2015, is no stranger to tele-land. With a career spanning more than a decade, she has essayed notable characters in hit television shows like\nHouse\n,\nBones\n,\nLaw & Order\nand\nPerson of Interest\n. Earlier this year, she starred alongside Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the science fantasy,\nThe Dark Tower,\nand also lent her voice for the recently-released activisation game,\nCall of Duty - World War II\n.', 'Defence training', 'While the\nVikings\nshoot is demanding, Winnick attributes the success of the show to the team’s collaborative effort. In the series, she also finally brings in her martial arts background. Laughing that though she may not look like she can hold her own in a fight, she reveals her martial arts — she started training in Taekwondo at the age of seven, and went on to earn her black belt by 13 and open her first martial arts school by the age of 16 — gave her confidence growing up.', 'And today, in a bid to help women stand up for themselves in dire circumstances, she runs a self-defence school called Win Kai Self Defense. “I strongly want, with a personal passion, to be able to arm every woman, every girl out there with the knowledge that they need to protect themselves,” affirms Winnick, who is also a trained bodyguard with a degree in kinesiology from York University.', 'Up next', 'Along with playing Lagertha, the actress is all geared to direct an episode of\nVikings,\nin season six, thus realising her long standing dream to get behind the camera. “I’ve been on the same set for six years now. I’m excited about telling a story from a different medium — not just acting, but also directing,” she says. Ask her about how she sees her character evolving and she chooses to keep mum. However, she does drop a few hints that her character may be bowing out of the series soon, in a poignant but expected plot twist.', 'Vikings\nairs every Monday – Friday at 10 pm on AXN']"
Chennai,"['Warning: Minor spoilers ahead', 'The\nMindhunter\npilot opens with Holden Ford (Jonathan Groff), a young FBI detective, entering negotiation talks with a lone gunman who’s held hostages. It doesn’t end well for the gunman, who shoots himself in the head. No hostage is harmed. This is, by all means, a success for the agent and the Bureau. But Ford wonders if he could have handled things better. What if he understood what drove the gunman to such desperate lengths?', 'Mindhunter\n, created by Joe Penhall, is the new Netflix show about US crime enforcement officers in the late 1970s — especially Ford, and ally/mentor/partner Bill Tench (Holt McCallany) — familiarising themselves with a new breed of criminal: the serial killer. If movie genres had prequels,\nMindhunter\nwould be the origin movie of every serial killer drama ever created.', 'Unlike the cocksure, quick-on-the-trigger investigative officers of present day serial killer shows (I’m looking at you, DSI Stella Gibson), the duo finds themselves grappling with monsters they don’t understand. When Tench offers Ford the chance to travel with him across the country to train local police officers and help them better understand the criminal mind, the latter sees an opportunity. He coaxes his boss to allow a research that would involve interviewing gruesome murderers held captive in prisons in different US states.', 'David Fincher, who serves as executive producer on the show (his second for Netflix, after\nHouse of Cards\n), directs four of the 10 episodes. The director returns to the genre after crafting the brilliant\nZodiac\nin 2007. Along with\nSeven\nin 1995, this can be considered to be a trilogy of sorts for Fincher — each serial killer drama set apart by a decade. The era recreated in\nMindhunter\nis the same as that in\nZodiac\n, about the hunt for a murderer who terrorised America in the ’60s and ’70s.', 'In one of\nZodiac\n’s greatest scenes, three detectives interrogated suspect Arthur Leigh Allen, during the course of which he became the prime suspect.\nMindhunter\nrecreates the sinister undercurrent of that interaction in a series of scenes. Except, rather than the ‘whodunit’ approach of most such fiction,\nMindhunter\nis concerned with the ‘why’ of it. The impact is as spine-chilling, especially in scenes involving the ‘Coed Killer’ Edward Kemper, played with icy-cool casualness by Cameron Britton.', 'Murderers on the show, like Kemper, are forthcoming about their handiwork; they view their crimes as trophies rather than shameful acts, which opens up opportunities for brazen, in-depth chats about their motivations. In order to satiate the hunger of those audiences who may want to see crimes ‘solved’ and not just ‘analysed’ in post-mortem, the writers throw in a couple of cases for Ford and Tench to crack during their travels. The chemistry between the two officers is dynamic, creating scope for humour even while the subject of their conversations remains morbid.', 'Ford, as is the norm with most American shows, shows glimpses of ‘breaking bad’ — it’s like Groff goes from channelling Andrew Garfield to Jesse Eisenberg in\nThe Social Network\nover the course of the season. I won’t be surprised if he’s himself the sociopath-in-the-making here, realising his true potential in forthcoming editions.', 'Season 1 is now available on Netflix India.', 'This column helps you navigate online (and offline) television, a world of endless options.']"
Chennai,"['TILT, the home accessories brand and brainchild of industrial designer Michael Foley, opened its first store at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) last month. Known for his cutting edge work during a decade-long stint at Titan, Foley is hoping to redefine the way Indians look at home accessories through a “thoughtfully designed range of products” that eschew ornamentation for greater attention to detail. “My principle is to extract the excess out of an idea,” he says. “What is left is pure enough as design intent.”', 'Pared down', 'After Titan, the 46-year-old set up his design studio, Foley Designs, in 2006, where he worked with several large corporates as a consultant to create lifestyle accessories. “I started making products primarily as an expression of what a deign studio could do,” he says. TILT was conceived in August 2015, after he and his team spent more than two years researching the types of products they wanted to create. “We are focussed on the idea of romanticising experiences at home,” says the designer, adding, “What has worked in India till now is ornamentation. We wanted to challenge that with expressions of craftsmanship and a certain minimalist approach to embellishment.”', 'Foley doesn’t want TILT to be a mantelpiece brand; he wants to create useful objects that are functionally innovative. Like the Ampulla copper carafe (Rs. 2,200) that draws inspiration from the traditional\nlota\n— the handle-less design is flared to ensure good grip. Or the Scoop vase (Rs. 1,650), which makes the flower the hero — it comprises a single marble slab with a scoop to hold water and a thin wire to balance the stalk. “We chose the name TILT because we felt it shows the essence of being a little more than normal; the name gives us cues for a little extra,” he explains.', 'Mixed media', 'The brand started off with around 30 tableware designs, and has already scaled up to 100, to include desk accessories, lamps and occasion-based products. The NID graduate, who is involved in each piece from design to development, works with a variety of mixed media, like wood, copper, stone, solid acrylics, aluminium and steel. Everything is crafted in-house with special focus on last mile finish, as Foley places a premium on quality. “We don’t want our products to have a shape signature. It’s the simplicity and attention to detail that bind them,” he says. One of our favourites is Spectre (Rs. 2,600), a minimalist lamp that plays with mirrors and reflections to move the light around.', 'Foley says the response so far has been encouraging, but a change in sensibility — from ornamentation to an appreciation for attention to detail — will take time. Currently retailing at the KIA store, online, and through a few boutiques, there are plans to open a standalone store early next year. Meanwhile, larger products like mirrors that explore textures on glass, functional objects with innovative solutions, like a shoe rack that reduces odour, and designs with embedded technology, like intuitive lighting, are in the pipeline. “Technology is important to the extent of making a product useful and not gimmicky,” he says, concluding, “We want to drive technology in an immersive and intuitive manner.”', 'From Rs. 450 onwards, on tiltstore.in.']"

Chennai,"['“It’s been a sad day for goats,” William Dalrymple says, when I meet him ahead of his performance with singer Vidya Shah at the launch of\nThe Hindu\nNovember Fest last week. His Instagram account describes him as goatherd and\nkabooter baz\n, and in interviews, he is frequently pictured caressing all manner of caprinae. Gilbert, once king of Dalrymple’s flock, was displaced by his son Freud (horn envy seems an inevitable consequence with a name like that) — an event that put him in such despair, he had to be put down. “It’s interesting goats get depressed just like people do. They put their heads against the wall and don’t want to go on. It happened to Gilbert’s mother, Georgina, too. She had a still birth and it undid her, she just sat looking at the ground and died within a month.”', 'Stories about the last king are Dalrymple’s staple, but he tells me his next book will be a shift in gears. It will still feature a king, the Persian emperor Nader Shah, but it is really about a 60-year period in history when the wealthiest empire in the world is taken over by a boardroom of London merchants, giving rise to the East India Company. “It’s almost the first company in the whole world. From the Medicis in 15th century Florence, to a bunch of Sindhi merchants sitting on the coast of Porbandar in Kutch, businesses had always been family affairs. But to raise the capital necessary to trade at the other end of the world in the 16th century, the British invent the corporation, they have joint stock, and that changes the world more than anything else — more than Christianity, more than democracy. It has a universal take-up,” he says.', 'Rise of the corporation', 'The book, which may or may not be called\nThe Anarchy\n, will be Dalrymple’s most ambitious yet. “I’ve never done anything like it before,” he says. “All my books so far have been micro-studies of just two or three years, and they disguise their micro-ness in the great shaggy covering that makes it look like they’re about huge subjects.\nWhite Mughals\nis actually just a few years in Hyderabad,\nThe Last Mughal\nis two years in Delhi.” This one will cover 60 years, from the time Shah messes up the Mughal Empire, to 1803, when the British replace it, effectively by taking over Delhi, keeping the king as pensioner. “It’s a huge sweep of territory, people coming and going, playing lots of parts, all of which is very bad for the narrative. It’s like Chinese cooking for me.” Not a word has been written yet, which is normal, Dalrymple says. “The big history books take three to four years to research. I’m nowhere near the end.”', 'The Scottish historian and writer talks in great bursts of energy, frequently gesticulating with his arms. “It’s the most extraordinary bit of history,” he tells me. “When (the battle of) Plassey takes place, there’s only about 35 people working in that office, and yet this boardroom, this corporation, replaces the greatest and richest empire that India has ever seen… By 1802, the company has twice as many troops as the British army, and have the Mughal emperor in their back pocket. The weirdness is that Victorians rewrote history to make it look like a nationalist enterprise. Half of the book is not about the company versus India or the Mughals, it’s about the company against the British government — a struggle which goes on today in every legislature between lobbying groups who represent corporate interests.”', 'In continuity', 'The historical leap from 1803 to Donald Trump’s government, with its complicated ties to Russian business interests, is something that clearly excites Dalrymple. “The book is more topical than ever because this is the ultimate corporate takeover. Ditto with Modi’s India. It was the corporates who brought Modi to power with their massive ad campaigns and all the unquantifiable sums of money that went into the BJP for the last election. So this battle between the power of the state and the power of the corporation is the big story of our time, and the jury is out on who’s going to win,” he says.', 'Of course, as all historians know, the more things change, the more they stay the same. When I ask about historical continuity in India, he tells me the reason so much in the country stays the same amidst change is because of the way families are locked in. “When I was doing\nNine Lives\n, coming down here to write about Chola bronze makers — who are still sitting in a bend in the Cauvery, where they were plonked by Raja Raja Chola in 1100 — the same families are there making the same idols on the same bend in the Cauvery. No one has moved. It’s gone father to son for 37 generations since 1100.”', 'Continued on page 3', 'Continued from page 1', '', 'He’s quick to concede that this continuity can have negative influences; if you’re a sweeper for instance, it traps you into centuries of deprivation. But it can also offer important insights. “So when (art critic and historian) BN Goswamy was trying to write the history of (painter) Nainsukh, to find the history behind these amazing paintings, he just goes to the pilgrimage centre in Haridwar and looks up the family pilgrimage records and there they are in one volume. Father to son. Father to son. Every name of every painter in one single book.”', 'Keeping the optimism', 'But isn’t it also true, that for all this continuity, there are always multiple versions to the same story, and sometimes all this multiplicity can get confusing?', '“I remember writing\nHoly Mountain\nand thinking at the end of five years that I’ve seen the whole of the Middle East, all the major sights, been everywhere, talked to everyone. It’s a ridiculously arrogant thing to say, but I felt I understood it in a way I’ve never even begun to understand India,” he says, adding, “I’ve been running around this coastline for 30 years, but tomorrow I hope to see Fort St David (in Cuddalore), a major sight I’ve never seen before. It’s just endless!”', 'So, yes, history repeats itself, and yes we continue to ignore its lessons — but forget about looking backwards for a moment and give us a glimpse of the near future in this country. What do you see? I ask. “I’m not an admirer of this government,” Dalrymple states, “It’s Mussolini without the trains running on time. In the long term though, I’m a huge optimist for India. There are a million things that could go wrong, but everything I’ve read about its past has shown that India’s natural place is at the top of the top table, and, along with China, it should be the centre of the world again. Other than this period between 1498, when Vasco de Gama arrives, and 1947, when European gunboats and globalism put it into second rank for three to four hundred years, it’s been at the top. Pliny complained about all that Roman gold going East, and I think it will do so again. We’d really have to screw up in this country for that not to be the case within my lifetime.”', '', 'From the Medics in Florence, to a bunch of Sindhi merchants or Gujaratis sitting on the coast of Porbandar in Kutch, businesses had always been family affairs.

Today, home buyers in India are younger than ever, with the age group of 34-38 populating a majority of sale deeds.', 'With dual-income nuclear families having become the new norm, young married couples are the preferred customer ‘configuration’ for banks and home loan companies.', 'Their combined creditworthiness is boosted by the very healthy risk profile which banks see in people who have two decades or more of active professional life ahead of them. The result? The ability to buy a sizeable home in a good location today, locking in its value and capital appreciation potential.', 'Realty fundamentals', 'That said, youthful home buying enthusiasm should ideally be tempered with sound investment advice. While the Internet has certainly opened up the domain of real estate knowledge, it has unfortunately also added several levels of contamination from innumerable marketing channels. So much for finding the ‘perfect location’ for your ‘dream home’ online — according to Google AdWords, literally everything is perfect and ideal. You still need to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff on the basis of your own knowledge of the market.', 'Likewise, the decision to buy a home should not be influenced by other people’s thoughts and opinions. At the end of the day, this is a very personal decision which does not lend itself too well to ‘one-size-fits-all’ investment philosophies. While one young couple with a certain degree of financial agility may see a lot of sense in buying a home as soon as possible, another of comparable fiscal ability could be content to live out their lives in rental homes and invest their surplus money elsewhere.', 'There is also no shortage of fence-sitting real estate agnostics who are perpetually waiting for changing market dynamics, rather than their own innate desires, to convince them of home purchase.', 'For now, let us consider the first set — young married couples who have firmly decided to buy a home.', 'The ‘starter home’', 'Definitely, young aspiringbuyers should keep in mind their current and future finances and balance these with their current needs.', 'The concept of ‘starter homes’ is a very valid one in India — the kind of homes that a majority of young couples prefer or able to buy in the initial stages of their careers and/or married life. Such homes are generally only as big as they need to be but are in well-connected locations which allow for easy transit to and from work.', 'The idea of buying a starter home is to secure a property within one’s existing means, and then upgrade to a larger home as the family as well as financial capability grows. Ensuring that the starter home, though compact, is in a good project with good amenities, and in a well-connected location, will enable the couple to sell it off more quickly and at a better price when the time to upgrade to a larger flat finally comes.', 'This is by no means the default choice for all young couples — many prefer to invest in larger homes, which their combined credit-worthiness can certainly permit. Herein lies a primary fact of the market — a budget for home purchase is not always only a function of financial ability, but often also of personal choice.', 'Deciding the budget', 'When it comes to decidingon how much to spend on buying a home, much depends on whether the newly-baked family comprises of a single income earner or whether it is a dual-income scenario. If it is a single-income household, a starter home in a good project by a reputed developer is the way to go. In the case of a dual-income situation, a couple can set its sights a little higher — but it is important not to overreach.', 'The main focus at this point in one’s family life should be to secure home while simultaneously retaining the ability to enjoy the first years of married life in reasonable style. Travel and entertainment will and should be on the cards. Later, they also need to factor in the financial pressures of parenthood, and these eventualities should be prepared for in advance. The objective for a newly-married couple — unless they come from wealthy families — should not be to immediately buy the biggest, flashiest home on the block.', 'Buy or rent?', 'For a considerable segment of young married couples in India today, the purchase of a home is definitely still a priority because it frees the family of empty rental expenses which reap no returns and instead secures a performing asset which will appreciate in value. With the predictable expense of monthly EMIs on a home loan factored in, one gets a clear view of other available investment options. Also, a self-owned home in India has a singular power to provide not only accommodation but also a sense of security and comfort.', 'For others, it makes more sense to stay in rental homes and invest into other instruments like mutual funds or even more adventurous speculation on the stock market. While it is obviously a challenge to judge how many young couples in India lean towards one philosophy or the other, what can be said is that home purchase has become a far more attractive option in India than ever before.', 'Current market', 'Over the past couple ofyears, we have seen significant property price rationalisation in many cities. As a result, many more properties have now become affordable for a much larger cross-section of aspiring buyers. Also, thanks to more ready inventory, the wait for possession has ended.', 'We will not see any further lowering of prices, especially now that RERA is cleaning up the market of fly-by-night operators and causing supply to slow down. However, as of now, residential property in India has become more affordable than it has been in several years. Simultaneously, home loan interest rates have declined to further boost the logic of home ownership in the country.', 'As the economy gathers further impetus and the real estate market recovers faster, bringing with it inevitable price escalations, locking into the currently prevailing low rates is the best possible investment choice for those who have decided on buying a home. Even the extended suburbs of our larger cities will get denser over the coming years, adding better social infrastructure while simultaneously bringing forth a dearth of supply due to depleting land.', 'As our cities expand, today’s extended suburbs will become more central locations. Buying a property in such locations now will lock in their future potential', 'Investment rationale', ""While the Internet, as wellas advisory columns in financial dailies, continue to offer conflicting advice, one immutable fact of the property market remains — property always appreciates in the long run. All over the world, real estate as an asset class provides excellent risk-adjusted returns in the long term.

So much for finding the ‘perfect location’ for your ‘dream home’ online — according to Google AdWords, literally everything is perfect and ideal. You still need to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff on the basis of your own knowledge of the market.', 'Likewise, the decision to buy a home should not be influenced by other people’s thoughts and opinions. At the end of the day, this is a very personal decision which does not lend itself too well to ‘one-size-fits-all’ investment philosophies.

Herein lies a primary fact of the market — a budget for home purchase is not always only a function of financial ability, but often also of personal choice.', 'Deciding the budget', 'When it comes to decidingon how much to spend on buying a home, much depends on whether the newly-baked family comprises of a single income earner or whether it is a dual-income scenario.

In the case of a dual-income situation, a couple can set its sights a little higher — but it is important not to overreach.', 'The main focus at this point in one’s family life should be to secure home while simultaneously retaining the ability to enjoy the first years of married life in reasonable style. Travel and entertainment will and should be on the cards. Later, they also need to factor in the financial pressures of parenthood, and these eventualities should be prepared for in advance. The objective for a newly-married couple — unless they come from wealthy families — should not be to immediately buy the biggest, flashiest home on the block.', 'Buy or rent?', 'For a considerable segment of young married couples in India today, the purchase of a home is definitely still a priority because it frees the family of empty rental expenses which reap no returns and instead secures a performing asset which will appreciate in value. With the predictable expense of monthly EMIs on a home loan factored in, one gets a clear view of other available investment options. Also, a self-owned home in India has a singular power to provide not only accommodation but also a sense of security and comfort.', 'For others, it makes more sense to stay in rental homes and invest into other instruments like mutual funds or even more adventurous speculation on the stock market. While it is obviously a challenge to judge how many young couples in India lean towards one philosophy or the other, what can be said is that home purchase has become a far more attractive option in India than ever before.', 'Current market', 'Over the past couple ofyears, we have seen significant property price rationalisation in many cities. As a result, many more properties have now become affordable for a much larger cross-section of aspiring buyers. Also, thanks to more ready inventory, the wait for possession has ended.', 'We will not see any further lowering of prices, especially now that RERA is cleaning up the market of fly-by-night operators and causing supply to slow down. However, as of now, residential property in India has become more affordable than it has been in several years. Simultaneously, home loan interest rates have declined to further boost the logic of home ownership in the country.', 'As the economy gathers further impetus and the real estate market recovers faster, bringing with it inevitable price escalations, locking into the currently prevailing low rates is the best possible investment choice for those who have decided on buying a home.

The world today is divided between those who walk around with hundreds of books and magazines on an e-reader, and those who still prefer to hold them by their spine. But the count of the latter is on the wane. Remember the fate of the once-popular magazines like\nCleo, MacWorld, Gourmet\nand\nVibe\n? All hope’s not lost though — luxury magazine,\nVogue\n, brought out its 100th print edition last year. Following in the footsteps of the West, a growing tribe of print warriors in India are fighting to sustain the print magazine, the definition of which has evolved over time. It’s less rigid in terms of genre and more focussed, and even has a cooler version — the zine. “If anyone has a hot topic and wants to get it out to the readers in a short, quick format, one can do so with a snappy new zine,” says Nupur Joshi, founder of Paper Planes, a magazine subscription portal. Like\nOh Nari, So Sanskari\n— a zine by young designer Annushka Hardikar, which took on society, traditions and our myths — or the latest edition of\nShowroom\n, which showcased vignettes of life, with ‘Some days’ as the theme. Bombay Underground, the pioneers of zine culture in the country, is also coming out with one on Amy Winehouse — with contributions from people who love her work — and another exclusively on cats! There are no restrictions to what you can publish in a zine, really. Here we bring you the three zines to follow, and the people behind them.', '', 'This is a magazine that already knows what the end will be like. Ten bi-annual issues and that’s it, confirms Shreya Dalmia. The fashion graduate from the London School of Fashion (with a specialisation in publishing) conceptualised it in her final year — a zine that would represent the modern side of India through bold visuals. “I wanted to build a crossover product, where both sides could feed off from,” says Dalmia, who launched the first issue of\nCurry\n(“called so, because it is the most popular Indian takeaway in London”) in February this year.', 'Flip through the 160-page zine, called\nTaste\n, and the topics — addressed by writers and artists from India and Europe — are what many conventional publications would keep a safe distance from. “We talk about homosexuality, we publish nude images... hard hitting content that is usually censored. But in the age of internet, censorship is a big farce. If you convey information in the right way, it becomes okay,” she shares, adding, “We also talk about religion, economics, politics and other sensitive issues through stellar designs. Someone has to speak about it, and art is a medium that we could use when no other freedom is allowed.” Working out of a small studio space in Kolkata, she, along with her team of two interns, is readying the next,\nComing of Age\n, a pack of five zines (to be launched by the end of the year) with contributors from Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Nepal, and so on. The brand Curry also holds zine-making workshops and sells merchandise. “Currently, we retail out of around 10 stores, three in Kolkata and the rest across cities such as Kochi, Jaipur, Delhi, Mumbai and Himachal Pradesh. You can also place a request online,” she signs off. Details: currymagazine.live', '', 'An annual from the popular Gaysi family, the zine is five issues old and is still being brought out by a team of two: Priya Gangwani, editor, and Sakshi, the founder, who manages “everything else”. It is a tangent of the online blog the organisation runs because, as Gangwani puts it, “We thought we needed it to give permanence to some stories and articles.', 'From a small print booklet — “brought out with our pocket money” — to 130 pages thick, the zine has evolved both in size and content. “The first three issues were generic, mostly revolving around what it means to be queer in India, and pushing the boundaries of sexuality and gender definition.” More recently, for issue four, Gaysi collaborated with 28 artists across the country, and explored the concept of storytelling using graphic narratives. The latest was based on the theme of ‘desire’. “Desire is the very crux of divide between the straight and queer community. The issue explores the realm of queer desires, not from the perspective of sex and sexuality, but more from the politics of desire,” says Gangwani, who crowdfunds every issue, explaining that it “allows us to also collaborate with the community”.', 'The issues cover everything from fiction, poetry, erotica and interviews, to activism and politics, and has featured writers such as Parvati Sharma, Roselyn D’Mello, artist Balbir Krishan and the popular women’s collective, Kadak.

Besides “consistently setting up reading spaces, with alternate material”, they organised the first ever Zine Festival in Mumbai earlier this year, and are now planning to take it across six cities. Many of their zines, such as\nEveryone is an Artist\nand\nStop Making Friends\n, are self published. The duo believes that “independent publishing is their response to the fact that most publishing houses and bookstores are either ignorant of radical literature and zines, or deliberately exclude such materials”.', 'One of their popular ones is\nA5\n, which addresses a wide variety of topics such as gender, caste, cross culture, feminism and patriarchy, over the course of 24 issues. “Sometimes, we put out an open call to people contributing on various topics. Our 17th issue had 14 contributors, ranging from college students to professional photographers, to movie directors and more,” says Himanshu, who is also trying to reopen discourses that evoke a grassroot change (that once used to be the prerogative of small-scale printing presses, which are now fast shutting down). “Some of our zines also come from our neighbourhood projects in Dharavi. These contain a plethora of subjects — from rethinking girlhood and dismantling it, to documenting Dharavi from the perspective of the women there,” Thami adds.', 'Though funding is a constant worry, they are now working towards establishing a zine library.

Instead, parents can fight fire with fire — to their benefit, in this case — and actively use parental control apps.

Saurin Parikh, father of a seven-year-old, uses pattern locks on apps, has a visible screen policy, where he makes sure that his child uses his device only in front of parents. Bengaluru-based parenting blogger, Shailaja V, has a similar rule where her 11-year-old daughter can use her parents’ laptop for school work only under adult supervision and in a family room. She also uses an app called Kids Place that locks apps and restricts internet access on devices.

But just because kids are tech savvy does not mean that they are equipped to deal with the dangers that come with the territory,” she says.', 'Talk about it', 'Both Shailaja and Naik recall that their daughters had been curious about the Blue Whale challenge. They engaged the children in a discussion about the aftermath of the completed “challenge” and it gave the parent and child some much-needed insight into each others worlds. “We need to acknowledge and respect their own levels of intelligence when we share our perspectives as adults,” says Naik.', 'Parents have to tread the fine line between policing screen time and being approachable to conversation about what happens online, says Mandiram. She explains, “A controlling attitude won’t work here, neither will underhanded ways like peeping into their devices. Kids need privacy as well, especially as emotionally vulnerable adolescents. Set practical boundaries, like no devices for an hour before bedtime. And avoid the advisory tone when talking to them about their social media lives. Engage them in conversation and build the trust that they can come to you with any problems.”', 'Young children can benefit from technology in marvellous ways, and these parental control apps are helpful when it comes to ensuring basic safety while reining in internet usage.

Ditto with Modi’s India. It was the corporates who brought Modi to power with their massive ad campaigns and all the unquantifiable sums of money that went into the BJP for the last election. So this battle between the power of the state and the power of the corporation is the big story of our time, and the jury is out on who’s going to win,” he says.', 'Of course, as all historians know, the more things change, the more they stay the same. When I ask about historical continuity in India, he tells me the reason so much in the country stays the same amidst change is because of the way families are locked in. “When I was doing\nNine Lives\n, coming down here to write about Chola bronze makers — who are still sitting in a bend in the Cauvery, where they were plonked by Raja Raja Chola in 1100 — the same families are there making the same idols on the same bend in the Cauvery. No one has moved. It’s gone father to son for 37 generations since 1100.”', 'He’s quick to concede that this continuity can have negative influences; if you’re a sweeper for instance, it traps you into centuries of deprivation. But it can also offer important insights. “So when (art critic and historian) BN Goswamy was trying to write the history of (painter) Nainsukh, to find the history behind these amazing paintings, he just goes to the pilgrimage centre in Haridwar and looks up the family pilgrimage records and there they are in one volume. Father to son. Father to son. Every name of every painter in one single book.”', 'Keeping the optimism', 'But isn’t it also true, that for all this continuity, there are always multiple versions to the same story, and sometimes all this multiplicity can get confusing?', '“I remember writing\nHoly Mountain\nand thinking at the end of five years that I’ve seen the whole of the Middle East, all the major sights, been everywhere, talked to everyone. It’s a ridiculously arrogant thing to say, but I felt I understood it in a way I’ve never even begun to understand India,” he says, adding, “I’ve been running around this coastline for 30 years, but tomorrow I hope to see Fort St David (in Cuddalore), a major sight I’ve never seen before. It’s just endless!”', 'So, yes, history repeats itself, and yes we continue to ignore its lessons — but forget about looking backwards for a moment and give us a glimpse of the near future in this country. What do you see? I ask. “I’m not an admirer of this government,” Dalrymple states, “It’s Mussolini without the trains running on time. In the long term though, I’m a huge optimist for India. There are a million things that could go wrong, but everything I’ve read about its past has shown that India’s natural place is at the top of the top table, and, along with China, it should be the centre of the world again. Other than this period between 1498, when Vasco de Gama arrives, and 1947, when European gunboats and globalism put it into second rank for three to four hundred years, it’s been at the top.

In fact, it isn’t just about the female demographic, the message needs to be universal, she insists.', 'In\nVikings\n, Winnick plays warrior queen Lagertha. “I feel it’s a character people look up to; she stands up for herself and sticks up for what she believes in,” she says, sharing that her personal belief — of equality for men and women — finds resonance in the character. “I feel like I bring a lot of my own personal life to the role, and I care very deeply about who she is and how she’s portrayed.

There would be pictures of the established eminent, gracing soirées and such, with cultivated humility and poise. Then it all got replaced with Bollywood and cricket, and eventually so low became the denominator for people being featured on page 3 that they were simply termed socialites — a set of people whose only job was to be seen at social dos. They weren’t skilled or accomplished, merely entitled. Fewer life forms could have defined the privilege of sloth more accurately, including sloths! Today, or rather this generation, has exceeded all expectations and found a new low to replace the useless socialite.

The day came and went, and while influencers published photos of their new gear or taken\nwith\ntheir new gear, I was left grasping for a logical explanation as to why was I overlooked? In retrospect, it’s because I don’t have a few thousand likes to every selfie that I never put up with some half-baked malapropism of wisdom to accompany it. Also because I read books and follow grammar, which makes me unpopular?

For me, all that influencers do is arouse jealousy and anger over the fact that someone with vague linguistic expression, an ignorant disregard for parts of speech, and an uninspiring personality complemented with a drab dress sense is considered acceptably important while the good eggs get relegated. When big brands chase quantity over quality it’s the worst kind of encouragement to provide for people to make a conscientious concerted effort to achieve anything of objective importance. Instead, it says, take the short cut, prioritise gaining followers rather than letting it be the natural organic conclusion to your body of work. Perception is reality, motion is action.

For Neeraj, it was a documentary on Kabir which inspired him to take up a guitar and adapt it into his style.', 'The word ‘café’ reminds one of having a chilled out conversation with a friend in a café. “We don’t look at Kabir as a saint or the one on a pedestal; That way Kabir is the first member of the band. We treat him as a friend, have a musical dialogue with him, try to understand his views and see how we can match it with the 21st century way of thinking, our way of thinking.”', 'In their four-year journey, they have performed around 850 shows in the country and across the world.

We do not play anything except Kabir and we don’t do anything else for a living as well. Performing only Kabir, we have been able to pay rents in Mumbai, that is the biggest success story,” they share.', 'The group observes Kabir has been a part of our lives and existed in different forms. “So many artistes have explored Kabir through classical and folk music and bands like Agni and Indian Ocean have also dwelled in contemporary music. Anyone who has had Hindi as a subject has studied Kabir through textbooks.

Hyderabad,"['TILT, the home accessories brand and brainchild of industrial designer Michael Foley, opened its first store at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) last month. Known for his cutting edge work during a decade-long stint at Titan, Foley is hoping to redefine the way Indians look at home accessories through a “thoughtfully designed range of products” that eschew ornamentation for greater attention to detail. “My principle is to extract the excess out of an idea,” he says. “What is left is pure enough as design intent.”', 'Pared down', 'After Titan, the 46-year-old set up his design studio, Foley Designs, in 2006, where he worked with several large corporates as a consultant to create lifestyle accessories. “I started making products primarily as an expression of what a deign studio could do,” he says. TILT was conceived in August 2015, after he and his team spent more than two years researching the types of products they wanted to create. “We are focussed on the idea of romanticising experiences at home,” says the designer, adding, “What has worked in India till now is ornamentation. We wanted to challenge that with expressions of craftsmanship and a certain minimalist approach to embellishment.”', 'Foley doesn’t want TILT to be a mantelpiece brand; he wants to create useful objects that are functionally innovative. Like the Ampulla copper carafe (Rs. 2,200) that draws inspiration from the traditional\nlota\n— the handle-less design is flared to ensure good grip. Or the Scoop vase (Rs. 1,650), which makes the flower the hero — it comprises a single marble slab with a scoop to hold water and a thin wire to balance the stalk. “We chose the name TILT because we felt it shows the essence of being a little more than normal; the name gives us cues for a little extra,” he explains.', 'Mixed media', 'The brand started off with around 30 tableware designs, and has already scaled up to 100, to include desk accessories, lamps and occasion-based products. The NID graduate, who is involved in each piece from design to development, works with a variety of mixed media, like wood, copper, stone, solid acrylics, aluminium and steel. Everything is crafted in-house with special focus on last mile finish, as Foley places a premium on quality. “We don’t want our products to have a shape signature. It’s the simplicity and attention to detail that bind them,” he says. One of our favourites is Spectre (Rs. 2,600), a minimalist lamp that plays with mirrors and reflections to move the light around.', 'Foley says the response so far has been encouraging, but a change in sensibility — from ornamentation to an appreciation for attention to detail — will take time. Currently retailing at the KIA store, online, and through a few boutiques, there are plans to open a standalone store early next year. Meanwhile, larger products like mirrors that explore textures on glass, functional objects with innovative solutions, like a shoe rack that reduces odour, and designs with embedded technology, like intuitive lighting, are in the pipeline. “Technology is important to the extent of making a product useful and not gimmicky,” he says, concluding, “We want to drive technology in an immersive and intuitive manner.”', 'From Rs. 450 onwards, on tiltstore.in.']"

Half of the book is not about the company versus India or the Mughals, it’s about the company against the British government — a struggle which goes on today in every legislature between lobbying groups who represent corporate interests.”', 'In continuity', 'The historical leap from 1803 to Donald Trump’s government, with its complicated ties to Russian business interests, is something that clearly excites Dalrymple. “The book is more topical than ever because this is the ultimate corporate takeover. Ditto with Modi’s India. It was the corporates who brought Modi to power with their massive ad campaigns and all the unquantifiable sums of money that went into the BJP for the last election. So this battle between the power of the state and the power of the corporation is the big story of our time, and the jury is out on who’s going to win,” he says.', 'Of course, as all historians know, the more things change, the more they stay the same. When I ask about historical continuity in India, he tells me the reason so much in the country stays the same amidst change is because of the way families are locked in. “When I was doing\nNine Lives\n, coming down here to write about Chola bronze makers — who are still sitting in a bend in the Cauvery, where they were plonked by Raja Raja Chola in 1100 — the same families are there making the same idols on the same bend in the Cauvery. No one has moved. It’s gone father to son for 37 generations since 1100.”', 'He’s quick to concede that this continuity can have negative influences; if you’re a sweeper for instance, it traps you into centuries of deprivation. But it can also offer important insights. “So when (art critic and historian) BN Goswamy was trying to write the history of (painter) Nainsukh, to find the history behind these amazing paintings, he just goes to the pilgrimage centre in Haridwar and looks up the family pilgrimage records and there they are in one volume. Father to son. Father to son. Every name of every painter in one single book.”', 'Keeping the optimism', 'But isn’t it also true, that for all this continuity, there are always multiple versions to the same story, and sometimes all this multiplicity can get confusing?', '“I remember writing\nHoly Mountain\nand thinking at the end of five years that I’ve seen the whole of the Middle East, all the major sights, been everywhere, talked to everyone. It’s a ridiculously arrogant thing to say, but I felt I understood it in a way I’ve never even begun to understand India,” he says, adding, “I’ve been running around this coastline for 30 years, but tomorrow I hope to see Fort St David (in Cuddalore), a major sight I’ve never seen before. It’s just endless!”', 'So, yes, history repeats itself, and yes we continue to ignore its lessons — but forget about looking backwards for a moment and give us a glimpse of the near future in this country. What do you see? I ask. “I’m not an admirer of this government,” Dalrymple states, “It’s Mussolini without the trains running on time. In the long term though, I’m a huge optimist for India. There are a million things that could go wrong, but everything I’ve read about its past has shown that India’s natural place is at the top of the top table, and, along with China, it should be the centre of the world again. Other than this period between 1498, when Vasco de Gama arrives, and 1947, when European gunboats and globalism put it into second rank for three to four hundred years, it’s been at the top. Pliny complained about all that Roman gold going East, and I think it will do so again. We’d really have to screw up in this country for that not to be the case within my lifetime.”', '“It’s been a sad day for goats,” William Dalrymple says, when I meet him ahead of his performance with singer Vidya Shah at the launch of The Hindu November Fest last week. His Instagram account describes him as goatherd and kabooter baz, and in interviews, he is frequently pictured caressing all manner of caprinae. Gilbert, once king of Dalrymple’s flock, was displaced by his son Freud (horn envy seems an inevitable consequence with a name like that) — an event that put him in such despair, he had to be put down. “It’s interesting goats get depressed just like people do. They put their heads against the wall and don’t want to go on. It happened to Gilbert’s mother, Georgina, too. She had a still birth and it undid her, she just sat looking at the ground and died within a month.”', '', 'From the Medicis in Florence, to a bunch of Sindhi merchants or Gujaratis sitting on the coast of Porbandar in Kutch, businesses had always been family affairs. But in order to raise the capital necessary to trade at the other end of the world in the 16th century, the British invent the corporation, and that changes the world more than anything else', '', '', '', 'Quick Take', '', 'Best thing about farm life:', 'Less smog', '', 'Biggest luxury:My lovely cook Biru’s masala omelettes by the pool', '', 'your children’s source of amusement:That I’m on social media more than they are', '', 'Most unusual collection of art you’ve seen recently:Oliver Hoare’s collection of hand-carved 18th-century walrus ivory dildos known as scrimshaws', '', 'JLF 2018 highlights:Tom Stoppard, Hamid Karzai, Michael Ondaatje, Amy Tan, Helen Fielding', '', 'Next photography project:The Historian’s Eye are all photographs taken while researching my East India Company book,The Anarchy— ranging from Mughal Delhi to Nawabi Lucknow, Nizami Hyderabad, Company Calcutta, and Tipu’s Srirangapatnam', '', '']"

Demonetisation and hasty implementation of the GST had led to a slowdown in the economic growth. “On November 8, 2016 night, Narendra Modi demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes and he said the decision was meant to unearth black money, curb terrorism, and check the flow of fake currency from Pakistan. But what have the people of India gained from this adventure except to be recipient of fresh hardships,” he asked. Stating that the withdrawal of 86% of currency imposed severe hardships on India’s farmers and small industries and traders, Dr. Singh said that at least 100 persons died standing in queues outside banks. “The BJP government imposed fresh hardships on the people by hastily introducing GST, soon after demonetisation. GST is an idea which had the blessings of the Congress party, but we would have implemented it after due care and adequate preparation. Our aim was One Country One Tax,” he said.', 'Dr. Singh said that the GDP growth rate came down from 7.2% in 2015-16 to 5.7% in the first quarter of 2017-18. “Small industries and small traders are badly hurt. I don’t see any immediate recovery in sight,” he said.', 'Blaming the BJP government at the Centre for having failed to implement any of its promises, the former Prime Minister pointed out that Narendra Modi had promised the people of India during the election campaign that he will bring back all the black money that is hoarded overseas and deposit Rs15 lakh in the account of every citizen.', '“Now three and a half years have passed and the people of India ask: what has the Indian citizen gained from the BJP rule? Prices of essential commodities are going up, unemployment is increasing. The promise to create one crore jobs every year has proved to be a hollow one,” he said.', 'Recalling that India has a great tradition and culture of respecting all beliefs and religions, Dr. Singh said that India has welcomed all faiths like Judaism, Christianity, Islam etc. “We cherish religious harmony, we never imposed restrictions on what food we should eat or the dress we should wear. Unfortunately, within a short period of three and a half years of BJP rule, attempts are being made to hurt the secular and democratic fabric of the country.

Of course, I rediscovered it for myself as a teenager but it was in my blood and in the air, “ says Arad, who will be performing alongside her Canadian counterpart, JF Robitaille at the 13th edition of\nThe Hindu November Fest\n.', 'Though music had always been an inextricable part of her life, it was on a school camping trip that she first discovered her voice. “Someone started singing\nBig Yellow Taxi\nby Joni Mitchell and I knew all the words so I joined in, “ she says. People around her began complimenting her and encouraging her to sing again. And so she did. “I went on to get a degree in Theatre studies from Warwick because I wanted that university experience.

To point of view...That summer I left you..And we left the EU, “ she sings to a tune that is vaguely reminiscent of Dylan’s ‘The Times they are a changin’. The song was written last year in New York , she says, where she had retreated to nurse an aching heart. “It came around a very interesting timing in both my personal and political world ; it is a sad song for multiple reasons,” says Arad, adding that she often uses music to process and deal with things. Inevitably, that does mean a lot of love song, of course, but, “we both try to mix in more universal and social ideas and experiences, “ she smiles.', ""That's how the music gets in"", 'It was melody that first drew them together, traversing the 5,000 odd kms between London and Montreal via the World Wide Web. “We heard each other online and felt some sort of connection,” says Robitaille. They first met each other in person at a festival and went on to do a tour in Italy last September. “Back then we were just two solo artists doing the tour together,” he clarifies.', 'By the end of the tour, they had started singing harmony on each other’s songs and doing covers together. Their first single together, We got It coming, released earlier this year --this will also be performed at the November Fest-- happened soon after. “I think it is inevitable when you put two musicians together for a long period of time, they are going to start playing together. And now there is demand for more. After this tour ends we will get back in the studio, “laughs Robitaille,', 'Talking about the ongoing multi-city India tour, they both admit to being very excited by it. “We have never been to India before and are awed by the country’s cultural legacy.

With a view of St Francis Church and the green Parade Ground in Fort Kochi spread out in front, its old world beauty is from an architecture of rotund columns, thick laterite walls, tiled roof and wooden slated windows.', 'It is as charming now as it was to a young Francis Bernard in the 70s when he expressed a desire to his wife Coral to possess the house. The newly weds were taking a stroll down Parade Road, on which the edifice stands. To Coral the romanticism of living in a heritage house seemed daunting but to Francis it was a dream waiting to be realised. The couple began living in the 18,000 square foot house, first, on rent, for a few years, before they eventually bought it in the mid 70s.', 'Today, the Bernard Bungalow has a pride of place in the heritage zone and in the hearts of its owners.', 'Colonial past', '', 'It traces it origins to a small house, built by the Portuguese, that was razed during the Dutch invasion. The Dutch later rebuilt it and used it as their consulate. One of its noteworthy occupants has been the Dutch ambassador and in its vicissitudes housed an armoury with the Dutch flag raised and lowered daily from a post atop.', 'Of its post-Independence history, the house was used by the British and later came to belong to a Muslim family. The tea broking firm J Thomas & Company began operations here and Francis recalls an array of tea-tasting tables lined in a room on the first floor. Later Kesaria Tea Company worked out of the premises.', 'Before the house finally came into the hands of Francis and Coral it remained locked for a long period. In fact many remember it in that state. Francis who hails from the area, says that as a young boy he had many a time changed his football boots sitting on the frontage of the house, with no inkling that he would some day be its owner.', 'So, finally when the Bernards stepped in to make it home they were met with time-mauled floor planks and rafters. A thick carpet of decayed leaves blown in from the lush Raintrees outside through broken windows welcomed them. “We had to wade through layers of rotting leaves,” recalls Coral.', 'At this point, the couple says, many of their friends and family members expressed doubts about their living in a four-century old house.', 'Being spacious and large, “with so many small rooms” the couple set to organise their life in the house. Francis moved his ship repair workshop into the large ground floor. Shipping equipment filled the space and welding works were started. On the top floor, where the family lived, by now with their two small children, the windows were repaired. The half-decayed wood from the floor was ripped out and used as staircase banister and as the roof. The three-ft thick columns were chipped and fortified with cement. When Francis found the house sinking to one side, he skilfully redid the entire foundation , with clearance from the Archaeological Survey of India.', '“We raised the side of the wall that was sinking, on levers, and laid a new foundation. Slowly we did that all around. The house has a new foundation,”says Francis.', 'While the house had many rooms, large and small, it was not planned as a home. The couple tore down a thick wall to let the beauty of the Parade Maidan flood indoors. The house is now awash with sunlight and breeze, its maidan-facing long corridor dotted with cosy seating.', 'With the passage of time the welding unit was moved out and the large room downstairs now houses the family cars. As big houses in the area opened their premises to tourists and homestays began operating the Bernards too modified the rooms thus. Coral beautifully converted six rooms for travellers, four on the terrace and two on the ground floor.', '“Anybody who comes to this house, says ‘you have a beautiful house; it is well-maintained,’” says Francis, handing over credit for the well-maintained house to his wife.', 'As of now Bernard Bungalow, holding in its rooms a sweep of history, receives family, friends and guests with a warmth of its owners. It is now waiting impatiently to receive its most important guest, during Christmas, Francis and Coral’s first grandson. And history thus will go on...']"
Kochi,"['It’s pretty safe to say that DC’s attempts at creating a cinematic universe have been inconsistent at best, and the road ahead, as outlined by DC Entertainment’s studio DC Films, presents an even more confusing picture. What started with\nMan of Steel\nin 2013, as a response to Marvel Studios’ strong performances at the box office, has seen DC seemingly trying desperately to catch up with a ‘cinematic universe’ its competitor started building five years prior. This rush to establish a universe has given us four movies so far, in which we’ve already seen Superman’s rise as humanity’s saviour, his iconic clash with Batman in a mechanised suit, and his (apparent) demise at the hands of a Doomsday created by modern-day Lex Luthor. Response has generally been mixed, and in a telling sign of the times we live in, it is Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman who has had to swoop in and save the day while the jocks brawled it out.', 'A mountain to climb', 'It comes as no surprise then, that\nJustice League\nis referred to by the online community as ‘Wonder Woman and Friends’. Core League members Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and The Flash (Ezra Miller) are being introduced in the big team-up film, which also has to handle a massive apocalyptic invasion by big bad Darkseid’s underling Steppenwolf, a return arc for the dead Superman, and establishing bonds between the main characters worth caring about.', 'Director Zack Snyder is no stranger to massive apocalyptic set pieces, with a flair for visual storytelling. However, when a personal tragedy required him to step back from\nJustice League\n, the powers-that-be smartly brought in Joss Whedon, the man responsible for doing exactly what is required of\nJustice League\nfor competing camp Marvel with\nThe Avengers\nin 2012. Between an excellent cast of characters, Snyder’s massive action set pieces and Whedon’s storytelling chops,\nJustice League\nmay just have found the right mix of ingredients to continue the upswing for DC that started with\nWonder Woman\n.', 'It will be interesting to see how the movie manages to bring Superman back into the equation, and how his character adapts to the new tone of the films, seeing as Henry Cavill was given little to do in previous outings, beside being an indestructible plank in a red cape contemplating the reason for his own existence.', 'What’s next', 'Even more interesting than the fortunes of\nJustice League\n, which is guaranteed to make money regardless of critical reception, is the future of DC’s film slate. Reports suggest that the studio is abandoning the plan to make every film tie in with the larger narrative, and allow for more independent storytelling. This sounds like a good idea on paper, as DC does have a wealth of great stories to adapt from the comics, and gives directors more creative freedom. However, they’ve also gone on to announce a slew of projects already, some of which sound great (a Batgirl film directed by Whedon, a standalone Batman outing written by Affleck), while others a little bizarre (a Harley Quinn and Joker crime caper starring Jared Leto and Margot Robbie, and an unrelated Joker origin story produced by Martin Scorsese, with a different actor playing the Joker).', 'Damage control', 'Shifting back to the short-term, DC needs its immediate projects to succeed, and established properties, like the Batman film and Wonder Woman sequel, to do well. Gal Gadot has recently made a stand by saying that she will not do another Wonder Woman film unless the company breaks ties with RatPac Entertainment, co-founded by Brett Ratner, who has been accused of sexual harassment by many actresses and industry insiders. DC’s group editor Eddie Berganza has also been suspended due to similar allegations. With issues so close to a major release, the studio will be hoping that fans see the project on its artistic merit. Because whatever universe DC plans to build, it needs the Justice League to come together and hit a home run.', 'The one where we discuss all things freaky and geeky', '', '', 'A hairy situation', '', 'Justice Leagueis one of the most expensive films ever made. Part of this might be attributed to the post-production, which required the moustache Henry Cavill was sporting for a parallel film shoot to be digitally removed in every scene.']"

Kochi,"['The written word. How do you get the best out of it? The world today is divided between those who walk around with hundreds of books and magazines on an e-reader, and those who still prefer to hold them by their spine. But the count of the latter is on the wane. Remember the fate of the once-popular magazines like\nCleo, MacWorld, Gourmet\nand\nVibe\n? All hope’s not lost though — luxury magazine,\nVogue\n, brought out its 100th print edition last year. Following in the footsteps of the West, a growing tribe of print warriors in India are fighting to sustain the print magazine, the definition of which has evolved over time. It’s less rigid in terms of genre and more focussed, and even has a cooler version — the zine. “If anyone has a hot topic and wants to get it out to the readers in a short, quick format, one can do so with a snappy new zine,” says Nupur Joshi, founder of Paper Planes, a magazine subscription portal. Like\nOh Nari, So Sanskari\n— a zine by young designer Annushka Hardikar, which took on society, traditions and our myths — or the latest edition of\nShowroom\n, which showcased vignettes of life, with ‘Some days’ as the theme. Bombay Underground, the pioneers of zine culture in the country, is also coming out with one on Amy Winehouse — with contributions from people who love her work — and another exclusively on cats! There are no restrictions to what you can publish in a zine, really. Here we bring you the three zines to follow, and the people behind them.', '', 'This is a magazine that already knows what the end will be like. Ten bi-annual issues and that’s it, confirms Shreya Dalmia. The fashion graduate from the London School of Fashion (with a specialisation in publishing) conceptualised it in her final year — a zine that would represent the modern side of India through bold visuals. “I wanted to build a crossover product, where both sides could feed off from,” says Dalmia, who launched the first issue of\nCurry\n(“called so, because it is the most popular Indian takeaway in London”) in February this year.', 'Flip through the 160-page zine, called\nTaste\n, and the topics — addressed by writers and artists from India and Europe — are what many conventional publications would keep a safe distance from. “We talk about homosexuality, we publish nude images... hard hitting content that is usually censored. But in the age of internet, censorship is a big farce. If you convey information in the right way, it becomes okay,” she shares, adding, “We also talk about religion, economics, politics and other sensitive issues through stellar designs. Someone has to speak about it, and art is a medium that we could use when no other freedom is allowed.” Working out of a small studio space in Kolkata, she, along with her team of two interns, is readying the next,\nComing of Age\n, a pack of five zines (to be launched by the end of the year) with contributors from Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Nepal, and so on. The brand Curry also holds zine-making workshops and sells merchandise. “Currently, we retail out of around 10 stores, three in Kolkata and the rest across cities such as Kochi, Jaipur, Delhi, Mumbai and Himachal Pradesh. You can also place a request online,” she signs off. Details: currymagazine.live', '', 'An annual from the popular Gaysi family, the zine is five issues old and is still being brought out by a team of two: Priya Gangwani, editor, and Sakshi, the founder, who manages “everything else”. It is a tangent of the online blog the organisation runs because, as Gangwani puts it, “We thought we needed it to give permanence to some stories and articles.', 'From a small print booklet — “brought out with our pocket money” — to 130 pages thick, the zine has evolved both in size and content. “The first three issues were generic, mostly revolving around what it means to be queer in India, and pushing the boundaries of sexuality and gender definition.” More recently, for issue four, Gaysi collaborated with 28 artists across the country, and explored the concept of storytelling using graphic narratives. The latest was based on the theme of ‘desire’. “Desire is the very crux of divide between the straight and queer community. The issue explores the realm of queer desires, not from the perspective of sex and sexuality, but more from the politics of desire,” says Gangwani, who crowdfunds every issue, explaining that it “allows us to also collaborate with the community”.', 'The issues cover everything from fiction, poetry, erotica and interviews, to activism and politics, and has featured writers such as Parvati Sharma, Roselyn D’Mello, artist Balbir Krishan and the popular women’s collective, Kadak. They also organise movie screenings, social club nights and open mic talks, where “we talk about things that are considered taboo. It’s a bridge between straight and queer folks in Mumbai.

Many of their zines, such as\nEveryone is an Artist\nand\nStop Making Friends\n, are self published. The duo believes that “independent publishing is their response to the fact that most publishing houses and bookstores are either ignorant of radical literature and zines, or deliberately exclude such materials”.', 'One of their popular ones is\nA5\n, which addresses a wide variety of topics such as gender, caste, cross culture, feminism and patriarchy, over the course of 24 issues. “Sometimes, we put out an open call to people contributing on various topics. Our 17th issue had 14 contributors, ranging from college students to professional photographers, to movie directors and more,” says Himanshu, who is also trying to reopen discourses that evoke a grassroot change (that once used to be the prerogative of small-scale printing presses, which are now fast shutting down). “Some of our zines also come from our neighbourhood projects in Dharavi. These contain a plethora of subjects — from rethinking girlhood and dismantling it, to documenting Dharavi from the perspective of the women there,” Thami adds.', 'Though funding is a constant worry, they are now working towards establishing a zine library.

In fact, it isn’t just about the female demographic, the message needs to be universal, she insists.', 'In\nVikings\n, Winnick plays warrior queen Lagertha. “I feel it’s a character people look up to; she stands up for herself and sticks up for what she believes in,” she says, sharing that her personal belief — of equality for men and women — finds resonance in the character. “I feel like I bring a lot of my own personal life to the role, and I care very deeply about who she is and how she’s portrayed. What I love about playing Lagertha is that I’m constantly getting challenged,” she adds.', 'The Canadian-born actor, who won a Critics Choice Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for\nVikings\nin 2015, is no stranger to tele-land. With a career spanning more than a decade, she has essayed notable characters in hit television shows like\nHouse\n,\nBones\n,\nLaw & Order\nand\nPerson of Interest\n. Earlier this year, she starred alongside Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the science fantasy,\nThe Dark Tower,\nand also lent her voice for the recently-released activisation game,\nCall of Duty - World War II\n.', 'Defence training', 'While the\nVikings\nshoot is demanding, Winnick attributes the success of the show to the team’s collaborative effort. In the series, she also finally brings in her martial arts background. Laughing that though she may not look like she can hold her own in a fight, she reveals her martial arts — she started training in Taekwondo at the age of seven, and went on to earn her black belt by 13 and open her first martial arts school by the age of 16 — gave her confidence growing up.', 'And today, in a bid to help women stand up for themselves in dire circumstances, she runs a self-defence school called Win Kai Self Defense. “I strongly want, with a personal passion, to be able to arm every woman, every girl out there with the knowledge that they need to protect themselves,” affirms Winnick, who is also a trained bodyguard with a degree in kinesiology from York University.', 'Up next', 'Along with playing Lagertha, the actress is all geared to direct an episode of\nVikings,\nin season six, thus realising her long standing dream to get behind the camera. “I’ve been on the same set for six years now. I’m excited about telling a story from a different medium — not just acting, but also directing,” she says. Ask her about how she sees her character evolving and she chooses to keep mum. However, she does drop a few hints that her character may be bowing out of the series soon, in a poignant but expected plot twist.', 'Vikings\nairs every Monday – Friday at 10 pm on AXN']"
Kochi,"['TILT, the home accessories brand and brainchild of industrial designer Michael Foley, opened its first store at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) last month. Known for his cutting edge work during a decade-long stint at Titan, Foley is hoping to redefine the way Indians look at home accessories through a “thoughtfully designed range of products” that eschew ornamentation for greater attention to detail. “My principle is to extract the excess out of an idea,” he says. “What is left is pure enough as design intent.”', 'Pared down', 'After Titan, the 46-year-old set up his design studio, Foley Designs, in 2006, where he worked with several large corporates as a consultant to create lifestyle accessories. “I started making products primarily as an expression of what a deign studio could do,” he says. TILT was conceived in August 2015, after he and his team spent more than two years researching the types of products they wanted to create. “We are focussed on the idea of romanticising experiences at home,” says the designer, adding, “What has worked in India till now is ornamentation. We wanted to challenge that with expressions of craftsmanship and a certain minimalist approach to embellishment.”', 'Foley doesn’t want TILT to be a mantelpiece brand; he wants to create useful objects that are functionally innovative. Like the Ampulla copper carafe (Rs. 2,200) that draws inspiration from the traditional\nlota\n— the handle-less design is flared to ensure good grip. Or the Scoop vase (Rs. 1,650), which makes the flower the hero — it comprises a single marble slab with a scoop to hold water and a thin wire to balance the stalk. “We chose the name TILT because we felt it shows the essence of being a little more than normal; the name gives us cues for a little extra,” he explains.', 'Mixed media', 'The brand started off with around 30 tableware designs, and has already scaled up to 100, to include desk accessories, lamps and occasion-based products. The NID graduate, who is involved in each piece from design to development, works with a variety of mixed media, like wood, copper, stone, solid acrylics, aluminium and steel. Everything is crafted in-house with special focus on last mile finish, as Foley places a premium on quality. “We don’t want our products to have a shape signature. It’s the simplicity and attention to detail that bind them,” he says. One of our favourites is Spectre (Rs. 2,600), a minimalist lamp that plays with mirrors and reflections to move the light around.', 'Foley says the response so far has been encouraging, but a change in sensibility — from ornamentation to an appreciation for attention to detail — will take time. Currently retailing at the KIA store, online, and through a few boutiques, there are plans to open a standalone store early next year. Meanwhile, larger products like mirrors that explore textures on glass, functional objects with innovative solutions, like a shoe rack that reduces odour, and designs with embedded technology, like intuitive lighting, are in the pipeline. “Technology is important to the extent of making a product useful and not gimmicky,” he says, concluding, “We want to drive technology in an immersive and intuitive manner.”', 'From Rs. 450 onwards, on tiltstore.in.']"

There were more than 50,000 children affected globally with ROP and 500 children go blind in India. This estimate is based on blind schools survey, so this was just the tip of the iceberg, the actual burden is much more, she felt.', 'Primary cause', 'The primary cause for ROP was (hormonal) imbalance of IGF (Insulin like growth factor-I) and VEGF(Vascular endothelial growth factor). Initially, in the mother’s womb the IGF-I and VEGF levels were normal causing normal vessel growth and normal retina.', 'The balance is lost when the baby is born premature leading to abnormal blood vessels in retina, Dr Sameera explained.', 'The disease was tricky because most of the affected children behaved normally with very good visual acuity after early intervention.

But the smell of fresh baked Goan bread that wafts in the air will make you realise that this tiny house is actually a bakery and these people are gathered to get their daily bread.', 'Usually baked fresh twice a day (in the mornings and evenings), this bread is sold by the ‘poder’ on his bicycle. In fact, it isn’t uncommon to spot him cycle down residential localities with a big cane basket full of bread covered with tarpaulin to protect the ware from heat, dust and rains. For many Goans, the poder’s early morning cycle bell is a wake-up call of sorts. Priced at a modest Rs. 3 to Rs. 5, this bread is as quintessentially Goan as are its robust balchaos and cafreals.', 'Steeped in history', 'You may wonder, what’s so special about this Goan bread? Well, everything. Right from the way it is made, baked, and variety to the fact that it is also steeped in history.', 'It is believed that the Portuguese Jesuit priests taught the Goans how to bake bread. The hard-working Goans learnt the art quickly enough and the Goan\npao\nwas born. The word\npao\nis a Portuguese term for bread. But, some believe that it is a quarter of a loaf and that’s why it is known as\npao\n. A standing joke is that the poders would knead the dough with their legs and thus the name\npao\n(Hindi word for legs).', 'What’s in a shape', 'This bread comes in a variety of shapes and sizes. The most common one is the\npoiee\n(made from wheat flour and husk), which resembles a pita;\npao\n(soft variety);\nunndo\n(this has a hard crust and slit in between);\nkatro pao\n(soft bread shaped like a butterfly) and\nkakon\n(a circular bangle-shaped hard bread which is typically dipped in hot tea).', 'Each bread is paired with specific dishes. For example, dishes with a coconut gravy, such as chicken xacuti and mixed vegetable gravy, are eaten with either\npao\n,\npoiee\nor\nunndo\n. The other items like the\nchorusa pao\n,\nkanda bhaji/kapa\n(onion and potato pakoras),\nrass\nomelet with\npao\nare hot favourites for evening snacks. However, the ideal way to eat these breads is to toast them with butter and top with a sprinkling of sugar; a perfect snack.', 'In Goa, you will find the traditional bakeries not only in villages but also in towns and cities. According to All Goa Bakers Association, there are 300 registered bakers, but the unofficial number could be around 1,000. Their dark, dusty interiors are hot and humid, and you will come across bakers who do nothing but bake bread day and night. Typically, a bakery sells around 1,500 to 2,500 pieces of bread a day.', 'They start the process by pre-heating the oven, which takes a few hours. The dough is made from\nmaida\n, yeast, sugar and water. Completely handmade, there are no preservatives involved, and it is baked in a traditional wood-fired oven; a dome-like structure made from mud and bricks. For heat, firewood and coconut husk are traditionally used.', 'The tipsy baker', 'Researcher and writer, Maria de Lourdes Bravo da Costa Rodrigues, mentions that the basic technique of making bread is the same, except for one ingredient, which is toddy. “Earlier, as yeast was not available, bakers used toddy for fermentation. Toddy made the bread more flavourful and tasty.” But these days, palm toddy is not as easily available, as there are hardly any toddy tappers left in Goa. But venture into some of the South Goa villages and you might just stumble across a baker still using toddy to bake bread.', 'In the village of Velsao in South Goa, the bakery owned by Pedro Anton Fernandes is probably one of the few remaining ones where toddy is used to ferment the dough. Sheras Fernandes, a regular customer here, says, “Adding toddy to the dough not only makes it tastier, but also increases the shelf life of the bread. It stays fresh for more than two days.”', 'In fact, so celebrated is\npao\nin Goa that there’s an annual Poderachem Fest or Bakers Festival that is held in the village of Succour in North Goa. It is the time when bread lovers and bakers come together to help keep this baking tradition alive.', '', 'The word\npao\nis a Portuguese term for bread. But, some believe that it is a quarter of a loaf and that’s why it is known as\npao', '', 'Wood’s the trick', 'It is believed that wood-fired ovens boost the flavour of food. There is a significant difference in taste in food cooked in a wood-fired oven and an electric one. This is largely due to the even distribution of heat and the unique smoky flavour the food imbibes from the burning of wood.']"

So if we are steering in a different direction, we wanted to do a good job of it. We spent a lot of thinking how we can scare the audience,” laughs Siddharth.', 'Science and beyond', 'Milind and Siddharth, who share the writing credits, were scouting for a story and came across stories told from a scientific point of view and about paranormal activity. Then, there were a set of experiences from a friend. This story, which lends itself to a jugalbandi of science and the paranormal, got dramatised for the trilingual.', 'What is true and what’s fiction is a tricky question to address. “Around 60% is written based on the real story and then we took the liberty to dramatise,” says Milind. Siddharth feels it’s tough to delineate: “If you have experienced paranormal activity, the story is true for you; someone else might term it hallucination or interpret it in a different way. The questions are always there. As the story moves to the third act, we introduced a lot of fiction.”', 'The third act leading up to the climax, highlights a social issue. This, aver Milind and Siddharth, was intentional. This was their way of leaving the audience with a thought. “We come across certain news reports that make us wonder if things like this can happen even in India of 2017. We chose one such issue as the core of the film. Look at the story backwards, from this issue, and everything is connected to it. We didn’t hammer down the message but build into the story organically.”', 'Off with clichés', 'At the pre-production stage, the team worked with ‘to do’ and ‘not to do’ lists; the second list was longer as it pointed out all the clichés in horror cinema. So you won’t find dark, creepy corners. The houses in the hills where the drama unfolds are swathed in light and the colour palette is a mix of green, red and brown as against the predictable blue-black template.', 'The production and costume departments worked in sync to make this possible.', 'Among the highlights of\nGruham\nis the music and sound design. Composer Girishh Gopalakrishnan lets silence build up the tension in key scenes while hypnotising with his score in certain other segments. The emphasis is on minimal to moderate sound.', 'Girishh worked on the music for three and a half years, experimenting with at least four to five possibilities for different sequences. Looking back, he laughs and admits, “I worked on it for so long that finally Siddharth had to barge into my office and take away the music files and tell me I need to stop.” The sound design and cinematography (by Shreyaas Krishna) result in several moments to savour.', '', 'We come across certain news reports that make us wonder if things like this can happen even in India of 2017.

One minute, the audience was laughing and empathising with a limerick; the next, they were devastated about life, death and abuse; and soon enough, they were cheering in celebration of “grabbing patriarchy by the beard” and making it pay for every man, woman and child it has ever victimised.', 'But that’s exactly what poetry is supposed to do. “The best humour can still be serious: you start out with the humour, get the audience laughing, and then you undercut it with something that makes them think,” explains Merrill, poet, performer, co-writer and co-director of Slamming for Sydney Festival. He paints a mental image of a knife turning in their chest, as the still-laughing audience struggles to understand what’s happening to them.', 'At a poetry slam, there are no restrictions in terms of structure or content. “It could be a poem, a story, a monologue, but essentially, it’s a competition,” says Merrill, adding that it’s all just a platform for “someone who’s performing the spoken word.”', 'Merrill notes that a lot of politics and contemporary issues are coming up in poetry slams, and sees a clear reason for it. “ That’s mainly because there aren’t that many artistic outlets for people who come from more marginalised communities: they don’t see themselves reflected in television; they don’t get through the gatekeepers that are editors and casting directors... If you’ve got the ability to just write, and then speak in front of a live audience, it’s a bit liberating,” he says, “If you’re young and brown, and most of what we consume is white and middle-aged, it feels liberating to get up and speak, and be heard.”', '', 'At a poetry slam, there are no restrictions in terms of structure or content']"

Once, her teacher asked about pets. “Thinking that talking about a pet dog which didn’t do much except lying down with its head resting on the floor most of the time will not interest anybody, I said I had a monkey at home and described its funny facial features and its daily mischief.” The purpose was served as the class listened in rapt attention.', 'When slightly older, she wanted to do many things at the same time. “I wanted to be with wild animals, I wanted to be a rock star; I also wanted to be deep sea diver. This was not possible.”', 'She realised that in the world of stories, she could be whatever she wanted to and change roles day-to-day and even minute-by-minute. “That’s precisely why when I write stories, I immerse myself in it; I become the story and I inhabit that parallel universe; this has given me infinite freedom,” says Anand who has received Sahitya Akademi’s Bal Sahitya Puraskar 2017 for her book\nWild Child\n, a compilation of short stories. The book was republished with 50 per cent additional inputs with a new title\nIn Smoke.\nThe writer was in city to receive the award.', 'Anand is happy that writing children’s literature has given her access to over 3 lakh children with whom she engages today. These are children impacted by terrorism, those in conflict zones, in difficult circumstances coming from tribal and marginalised sections. Born to a senior journalist who was the first Indian chief editor of Statesman, Pran Chopra, she grew up in a house full of books; those have been the biggest influence in her life. “There were open shelves and we could read anything we wanted to, no restrictions. At the age of 12, I read Huxley. It really bothers me today when parents restrict their children from reading certain books,” she says.', '“My books have been banned in some schools after being deemed as inappropriate. In some other schools, it is recommended. What is inappropriate? Truth is inappropriate? I write about the truth; there are communities that hate other communities; I am not promoting hate; all I am saying is don’t hate each other, think.”', 'Her forthcoming book is a story of the aftermath of a rape of a young girl. “It’s a horrible story.

Vijayawada,"['Looking at a different eraMahesh Upputuri', 'Titles based on songs have been popular in Telugu cinema since the 70s. For director Mahesh Upputuri though, who’s coming up with the film\nSnehamera Jeevitham\nthis week, it was an opportunity to rekindle nostalgia. His earlier outings\nJagame Maaya\nand\nPaddanandi Premalo Mari\ntoo showcased his love for song titles. What gives\nSnehamera Jeevitham\n(as a title) more relevance is its 1982 setting. It was an opportunity that the director used to unleash great entertainment value with timely political, film and literary references in the Mandapeta Telugu dialect. “Songs are an apt way to summarise a theme of the film. I attribute it to my love for music, I grew up listening to songs of ANR, NTR,” the filmmaker says.', 'While Mahesh’s first film\nJagame Maya\ncouldn’t find a release, his next film, the Varun Sandesh-starrer\nPaddanandi Premalomari\nlost out to slew of releases on the same day. Though he earned kudos for the film’s technical values, his dialogues and its central theme, bad timing let him down. “The major change I’ve seen in myself as a filmmaker over these projects is my ability to translate what I’ve written on paper onto the celluloid. In the past, I relied on heavy-duty dialogues to do the job. I now understand how to communicate the core of my plot better. In\nSnehamera Jeevitham\n, you’ll see more visual metaphors,” he promises.', ""In a bid to lend authenticity to the film's 80s setting, he used props, the good-old ambassador cars, cycles, the trunk-call system, STD booths, references to politicians and actors besides advertisements as a few indicators. Given that he had a limited budget on hand, he couldn’t experiment beyond a certain point. As the film aims to be an ode to frendship, Mahesh weaved the plot with many personal references. The story reportedly throws light on a few communication gaps that destroys relationships.\nPrema Desam\nremains the director’s favourite film while dealing with this theme."", ""The lack of a big commercial star to nudge the film ahead doesn't bother him. Content-oriented films thriving in Telugu cinema now is proof that audience considers it more important than a big or a small hero, he says. Sivabalaji and Rajeev Kanakala are known more as actors over heroes, the lack of baggage came in handy for the director. “These are two stubborn, strong characters that every spectator would relate with. Even before I pitched the story to them, I looked at it as a character-oriented film that needed strong performances and not an aura surrounding them. They’ve taken forward the essence of the story beautifully,” Mahesh mentions that their off-screen camaraderie was an added advantage that reflected on-screen. That they were open-minded to understand, re-work and improvise on sets helped Mahesh’s cause."", ""Though many films deal with time-travel and two timeframes, not often do you see an entire film set in a single phase. How's a story set in 1982 still relevant in 2017? “This is a story that's universal and more of a nostalgic peek into such times. The visuals, the writing is upto the current-day scenario,” he replies."", ""As many as nine Telugu films await a release this week, the director doesn't find this an issue. “Every film will have its own audience,” he's confident."", '', 'I now understand how to communicate the core of my plot better. In\nSnehamera Jeevitham\n, you’ll see more visual metaphors']"

And that’s the challenge – to achieve the perfect landing,” says Joseph Llado, a ballooning pilot from Barcelona. One of world’s most experienced pilots with 38 years of experience, Joseph seemed thrilled to explore the virgin skies of Araku Valley during the recently-concluded hot air balloon festival. “Every place, country and landscape gives different kinds of challenge to us. Araku is beautiful and its hilly terrain makes it a fascinating place to explore its grandeur,” he says. Llado runs a balloon manufacturing company in Barcelona called Ultramagic which makes 50 different varieties of balloons. For him, ballooning has presented a lifetime of adventure. Seventy three years old Bonanna from Italy has a similar experience to share. “I fly for my pleasure. It is very relaxing when you are floating up there. All the worldly worries just sink within you and it is just you and the silence of nature to soak in,” says the cheerful pilot. This year in February, they both completed one of the most challenging and spectacular balloon flights of their lives. They made a journey across 500 km in Switzerland in nine hours and 45 minutes. “We went up to 5,000 feet and it was such a breathtaking experience! Our basket carried food, lamps and emergency stuff and we just headed off,” says Bonanna.', 'Recalling another amusing incident when he was flying above Africa, Llado says, “So I was preparing to land when the wind direction took me towards an unexplored forest area. Incidentally, at that point of time there was a priest surrounded by a group of followers was fervently praying with a bible in hand to stop ‘the end of the world’. When we landed they all rushed towards us with the bible in hand assuming that their prayers have been answered. We were treated like Gods there!” he chuckles.', 'Many times, the pilots spot a serene place to land only to be greeted with a huge crowd within no time! “This happened in Rajasthan. When I was preparing to land, I couldn’t spot a single person in the vicinity from above. As the basket touched the ground, there was a group of 200 people who came rushing to meet us!” says pilot Syed Karimulla. For the pilots, ballooning opens up a magnificent world that nobody knew even existed. “You often fly in to a place you never expected. It is discovering the secrets of nature in the most exciting way,” says pilot Rick Astral from Chile.', 'Apart from the ballooning event in Araku, the pilots stayed in a luxury eco-friendly camping site close to a tribal village where they also got to shake a leg with the Dhimsa dancers around the bonfire. In the evenings, the night glow held at NTR Grounds in Araku was a delightful sight for scores of people who thronged the venue. Many got a chance to go up in tethered balloons.']"

It also kills 50,000 people a year,” he informed.', 'Milk production', 'Referring to the dairy sector, he said India was the world’s largest milk producer, but this success was owed to a very large number of animals producing fairly small amounts of milk. In A.P., many of the indigenous cattle breeds owned by smallholder farmers produce only a fraction of the milk that’s possible.

Then, we saw a herd of something moving – more ambling than running. From a couple of thousand feet above sea level perched in a floating hot air balloon, whatever we were looking at appeared as small as farmyard toys below us.', 'We were up in the grey skies of Araku Valley, the quaint hill station about 120 km from Visakhapatnam, over the verdant hills and caressing breeze of the Eastern Ghats as I take my first balloon flight at the Araku Balloon Festival.', 'Romantic journey', 'We had taken off from a flat area near Bosebeda village, on way to Araku. In a basket barely enough to squeeze in two medium-built individuals with two cylinders placed in corners, the cheerful yellow balloon piloted by the charming Atiqah Khairudin from Malaysia kissed the cloudy skies minutes after it flew off the ground. It was a little chilly thousands of feet up and the views were nothing less than spectacular. But the best word to describe the short but exciting experience was gentle – a gently anxious take-off, gentle floating flight and a mildly edgy, gentle touchdown in a random farm field, a few kilometres away from the take-off site. Atiqah tells me that that hot air balloons are often a place where many a romance blooms where a brave boyfriend pops the question! “Sometimes, it is also a way to rekindle a lost love story where older couples come and renew their vows,” she adds.', 'Nature’s gems', 'As we silently float over fields of yellow niger flowers, interspersed with navigating streams and green valleys, Atiqah looks down and exclaims: “This is the most picturesque vista from the ultimate vantage point — the air!” The windy skies make me a bit nervous, but the pilot assures me that it is going to be the most exciting experience of my life. Hot air balloon rides are determined by the wind direction and it is often the call of the pilots whether at all to embark on the journey in the skies, how long to carry on and when to start the descend. Araku’s proximity to the Odisha border, a region known for Naxalite activity, and the direction of winds was a bit of deterrent. But the first day’s airborne journey, though for a short time, unravelled the beauty of Araku in ways never discovered before! “That’s the charm of going on a hot air balloons. You stumble upon the rarest of nature’s gems where no cars, helicopters or any other modes of transport can take you,” remarks Atiqah, almost reading my mind.', 'The first day of the event gave the organisers and pilots some nerve-wracking moments. With weather predictions indicating rainy days ahead, they launched a helium balloon to determine the wind direction. The smiles on the faces of the team of world’s most experienced pilots who arrived in the valley from 13 countries removed all apprehensions. And soon with favourable wind conditions, they unravelled and inflated 16 balloons, including three specially shaped ones - seahorse Neptuno, Iwi the Kiwi and Bee.', 'Panoramic view', 'As my journey in the skies almost nears an end, Atiqah says, “This beautiful piece of jewel is such a discovery for balloon pilots. It can be a great way to showcase its beauty to people who want to experience the grand panoramic view from the hot air balloon.” As we sail over the tribal hamlets and agricultural fields, all around us the sky fills with more hot air balloons looking like tiny dots of colourful confetti.', 'The winds have stabilised a bit, but the next challenge is to find a spot to land. Each balloonist has two radio sets — one for the pilot and the other for the staff below. While I find myself immersed in the magical scenes unfolding before me, Atiqah gets ready to land and sends a message from her radio set. “The most different way to fly a hot air balloon is to fly low and the most challenging part is to get a deal landing,” says the confident young pilot. By now, the winds have again picked up pace. Beneath us, there are just fields of yellow niger fields. As she prepares for the final part of the landing, I can sense a slight anxiety in her voice. “We are heading for a bit of an adventurous landing this time. Just hold on!” she instructs.', 'While I tightly fix myself to the corner of the basket, the balloon makes quite a strong impact on the field as we hit the ground. For a second, my heart is in my mouth. Within no time, my anxiety meets the curious, excited faces of the villagers from the neighbouring tribal hamlet who run towards us to greet us with a warm hello. “This is the best part of ballooning.

Visakhapatnam,"['“An element of uncertainty is always there when you are up there in a hot air balloon. And that’s the challenge – to achieve the perfect landing,” says Joseph Llado, a ballooning pilot from Barcelona. One of world’s most experienced pilots with 38 years of experience, Joseph seemed thrilled to explore the virgin skies of Araku Valley during the recently-concluded hot air balloon festival. “Every place, country and landscape gives different kinds of challenge to us. Araku is beautiful and its hilly terrain makes it a fascinating place to explore its grandeur,” he says. Llado runs a balloon manufacturing company in Barcelona called Ultramagic which makes 50 different varieties of balloons. For him, ballooning has presented a lifetime of adventure. Seventy three years old Bonanna from Italy has a similar experience to share. “I fly for my pleasure. It is very relaxing when you are floating up there. All the worldly worries just sink within you and it is just you and the silence of nature to soak in,” says the cheerful pilot. This year in February, they both completed one of the most challenging and spectacular balloon flights of their lives. They made a journey across 500 km in Switzerland in nine hours and 45 minutes. “We went up to 5,000 feet and it was such a breathtaking experience! Our basket carried food, lamps and emergency stuff and we just headed off,” says Bonanna.', 'Recalling another amusing incident when he was flying above Africa, Llado says, “So I was preparing to land when the wind direction took me towards an unexplored forest area. Incidentally, at that point of time there was a priest surrounded by a group of followers was fervently praying with a bible in hand to stop ‘the end of the world’. When we landed they all rushed towards us with the bible in hand assuming that their prayers have been answered. We were treated like Gods there!” he chuckles.', 'Many times, the pilots spot a serene place to land only to be greeted with a huge crowd within no time! “This happened in Rajasthan. When I was preparing to land, I couldn’t spot a single person in the vicinity from above. As the basket touched the ground, there was a group of 200 people who came rushing to meet us!” says pilot Syed Karimulla. For the pilots, ballooning opens up a magnificent world that nobody knew even existed. “You often fly in to a place you never expected. It is discovering the secrets of nature in the most exciting way,” says pilot Rick Astral from Chile.', 'Apart from the ballooning event in Araku, the pilots stayed in a luxury eco-friendly camping site close to a tribal village where they also got to shake a leg with the Dhimsa dancers around the bonfire. In the evenings, the night glow held at NTR Grounds in Araku was a delightful sight for scores of people who thronged the venue. Many got a chance to go up in tethered balloons.']"

As Karnataka heads for the Legislative Assembly elections next year, he says that political parties should commit themselves in their manifestos to implementing Kannada as the compulsory language of instruction if voted to power. Excerpts from an interview:', 'You were in the forefront of the Bandaya (rebel) Sahitya Sammelana organised opposing the Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana in 1979 chaired by poet Gopalakrishna Adiga. After 38 years, you are occupying the same chair. How do you justify that?', 'Boycotting the sammelana at that point of time was a historical inevitability, as the [Kannada Sahitya] Parishat was controlled by upper caste and class. Despite our appeal, the then president of the parishat Hampa Nagarajaiah refused to accommodate a session on Dalit issues. This triggered all progressive forces to unite and hold the Bandaya Sahitya Sammelana in Bengaluru. But within 10 years, there was a total transformation in the parishat’s attitude. Go.Ru. Channabasappa, president of the parishat, took the lead in celebrating ten years of the\nbandaya\nmovement. Now, the situation has changed vastly.', 'You are opposed to politicians inaugurating the sammelana. But now, you will share the dais with Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.', 'I am not against politicians participating in the sammelana per se. I want the Chief Minister to participate in the valedictory programme, as he could react to the issues raised and discussed and the resolutions passed. Politicians have to participate in sammelanas to understand the pulse of people.', 'There is a perception that your razor-sharp wit got blunted once you became part of the establishment.', 'You are mistaken. My targets have not changed, but situations have transformed in the last few years. I have become more subtle. Whatever I am saying metaphorically is making far-reaching impact.', 'Writer Devanur Mahadeva has declined to chair the sammelana till the government implements Kannada as the medium of instruction. Your thoughts.', 'I have great regards for my friend Mahadeva. I respect his stand. The difference between us is while he wants to fight the system from outside, I want to fight for the cause by being within the system. In my presidential address, I will seek a commitment from all political parties in their manifesto to fight for a constitutional amendment to facilitate regional languages, including Kannada, as the medium of instruction. It will be the duty of all presidents of the sammelana and the parishat to make all political parties honour this commitment, as the Parliamentary elections will be held just one year after the Assembly elections in Karnataka.', 'Considering the popularity of literature festivals, do you think there is a need to change the format of the sammelana too?', 'Literature festivals are an attempt by the corporate world to expand their market. They are commodifying culture and literature. There is no need for the sammelana to change its format as it is\nakshara jatre\n, a literary fair. Fair is a part of our diversified culture. There is no need to distort this format.', 'Since sammelana resolutions are barely honoured by the government, do you envisage any mechanism to counter it?', 'After the sammelana, along with presidents of previous sammelans, I will tour the length and breadth of Karnataka and educate people on the unresolved burning issues of the land and language. Besides that, I am planning to launch what I call a Kannada Sainya (Kannada army), comprising of Kannada organisations, over 1.5 lakh registered members of the parishat and others, to take up all the issues.', '', 'Literature festivals are an attempt by the corporate world to expand their market ...

Sharma of Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT-H.', 'The state of affairs can be gauged from the fact that the nomination dossier for UNESCO Qutb Shahi Monuments of Hyderabad listed only 15 monuments at the tombs’ location. In reality, when the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and Archaeology Department of Telangana began work at the site, they were confronted with dozens of monuments at the same location. Some of the monuments were not even in the same compound. “This was a result of a heritage tour course when students visited the Qutb Shahi tombs. The students measured the monuments using the app, which measures height based on the angle, and a measuring tape. Interestingly, many of the results agreed well with the actual measurements made by the Aga Khan Foundation, which is renovating the Qutb Shahi tombs. This textbook provides a novel approach for teaching high school geometry, and provides a holistic approach towards learning, where students are encouraged to use the knowledge available in their textbooks to identify and solve problems in their neighbourhood,” said Mr. Sharma.', 'The textbook is a work in progress and will be revised on the basis of feedback. “We thought this will help develop some kind of affinity for the local culture and heritage. Instead of using just measurements, we thought that a textbook-based approach would be more interactive. There are a number of monuments near IIT-Hyderabad and we plan to use a similar approach to document them,” said Mr. Sharma.', '“It began as an extra-curricular activity, but has now become a regular course at IIT-H.

The Navy looks at the entire concept through the prism of strategic capability building.”', 'Training is the raison-d’être of the Kochi-based Southern Naval Command, says Captain Suvrat Magon, Command Training Coordinating Officer.', '“It has been a constant endeavour to continuously audit the existing procedures, facilities and evolve new methods to provide relevant and effective training across the spectrum ranging from the ab initio stage to senior levels.

Estimates show that only about 6% of currency in circulation is black money,” he said.', 'Demonetisation had caused lots of distress to farmers and small industrialists, Dr. Singh said. The economy would remain in the doldrums for at least the next one year.', '“Even those who argue in favour of demonetisation, including the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister, admit that in the short run there will be problems. Small farmers and traders and small and medium industries, deprived of cash, suffered enormously. And those shocks have led to the slowing down of our economy,” he said.', 'Bank recapitalisation', 'To a student eager to get his reaction on the problem of non-performing assets draining the financial health of banks, Dr. Singh said he was glad that the government had announced that it would come up with a scheme to recapitalise the public sector banks.', '“Banks are a very important source of lending for industrial development. But when banks are burdened with non-performing assets, their ability and willingness to perform their traditional function of lending suffer. That’s why in recent years the rate of growth of bank credit has sharply declined. And if banks do not lend to the industry, industry cannot grow,” he said.', 'To a question on India’s standing among the economic giants, the former Prime Minister said “We need to work together and evolve a national consensus so that our economy can grow at a sustained manner at a rate of 8 to 10%. I think that’s possible and we, as a nation, have to find ways,” he said.', 'K.V.
